00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,480
Hello and welcome to your favorite
program, 'Rich and Famous.'

2
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,360
Where we introduce you
to rich and famous people.

3
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,080
Today we'll meet famous
industrialist and..

4
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,160
..owner of Malhotra group of industries,
Mr. Kailash Nath Malhotra.

5
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,760
Come on, I'll take you to
his splendid bungalow near Delhi.

6
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,080
Let me introduce you to Mr.
Kailash Nath Malhotra.

7
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,520
Greetings.

8
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,040
We want to know things about you
which the world has no idea about.

9
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,640
I'll tell you only if
it's worth telling to everyone.

10
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,480
Okay. First of all we
want to know about your family.

11
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,080
I have a big family.
I have a son, daughter-in-law.

12
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,440
I have a grandson and a
few relatives who stay with us.

13
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,720
I'll introduce them to you.

14
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,880
Come on.

15
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,640
Yes, me too!

16
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,760
Sit.

17
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,240
This is my son Ranjeet.

18
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,560
Hello. - Greetings.

19
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,320
This is my daughter-in-law Asha.

20
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,560
Hello. - Hello.

21
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,920
He is Ranjeet's brother-in-law,
Pankaj. - Hello!

22
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,080
His wife, Kanchan.

23
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,080
Hello! - Okay.

24
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
The rest is my staff.

25
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,000
Greetings!

26
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,000
Mr. Malhotra, generally there
are differences in a joint family.

27
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,600
What is secret of the peace
and joy your family enjoys?

28
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,960
It is simple.

29
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,320
My son runs the business and
his brother-in-law helps him out.

30
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,680
My daughter-in-law manages
the house with Kanchan's help.

31
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
And.. - I manage all of them.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,480
I mean I do all the work
in the house making calls.

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,080
I have influential contacts.

34
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,520
I know all the central
ministers and secretaries.

35
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
He's right.

36
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,960
If a TV set stops working,
he doesn't call a mechanic..

37
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,280
..but the minister for
information and broadcasting.

38
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,960
He is Pappu.

39
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,600
Son of our accountant.

40
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,880
He grew up in our
house since childhood.

41
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,200
He is like my son. - Yes.

42
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,400
If you have any work
with any minister.

43
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I'll get it done in a moment!

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,200
Please don't misunderstand.
This is his habit.

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,920
I see! - He's right.

46
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,800
What's the matter? Is a shooting
going on here for a soap opera?

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,920
We were missing the villain!

48
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,160
Welcome, sit down.

49
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,760
This is Dr. Balraj. - Hello.

50
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,840
He's my childhood friend
but he's no less than an enemy.

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,760
He has rationed my intake
of butter, salt and sugar.

52
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,120
He has even appointed
Pappu to spy on me.

53
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,680
If I had not done that,
you'd be chatting with god by now.

54
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
With so many diseases..
- What are you doing?

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,960
The camera is rolling.
- I'm sorry.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,160
All right. Yes, is my pose okay?

57
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,880
All right, Mr.
Malhotra, one last question.

58
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,640
Your family is so happy.
Your life is so successful.

59
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,480
Is there any wish now which
you are waiting to get fulfilled?

60
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,560
Yes, I'm waiting for a companion.

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,960
Are you thinking
of marriage at this age?

62
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,520
Marriage!?

63
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,080
No. I'm waiting
for my great grandson.

64
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,680
The one who would be my toy.

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,640
He'll be my support
instead of this stick.

66
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,120
He'll carry forward
my family's name.

67
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,880
So sweet!
When is your wait going to end?

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,400
When my grandson,
Raj, agrees to get married.

69
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,520
Presently he's attending
his friend's wedding.

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,080
You look very beautiful.

71
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,600
Please! No! - Go on.

72
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,360
Move back.

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,760
Come on.

74
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,120
Enough.

75
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,520
What is this, brother-in-law?
You cannot go.

76
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,640
What is this?

77
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,560
What is it?

78
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,120
Go and dance!

79
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,320
Thank you.

80
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,600
You're one up on the boys!
- Really?

81
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

82
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
Excuse me. - Yes?

83
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,080
You danced very well
at the function today.

84
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,680
You were saying something?

85
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,000
Your baby is very cute.

86
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,120
He has taken after you.

87
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,440
Thank you. Everyone says the same.

88
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,960
No, baby.

89
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,280
Okay. - Bye.

90
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
Bye.

91
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,120
Sister-in-law, take your son.

92
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,320
What was he saying? - Him?

93
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,480
Yes. - He said
my son is very cute.

94
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,960
He has taken after me.

95
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,080
He thought this baby is mine.

96
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,640
Chhotu! - Yes.

97
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,320
There's no running water.
- What are you saying

98
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes. - What is happening here?

99
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
You're not working you lazy bums!

100
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,720
You're gossiping!
- Pappu, we're not gossiping.

101
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,560
There's no running water.
It's blocked.

102
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,080
You cut the grass!

103
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,600
No running water?

104
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,600
Paps. - Raj!

105
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,520
Who are you calling up? - I'm
calling the irrigation minister.

106
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,960
Why? - There's no running water!

107
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,720
Call the plumber. - Why call
the plumber for small repair work?

108
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,720
Is the irrigation minister
just for irritation?

109
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,120
Correct. - Correct!

110
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,240
Okay.

111
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,000
Only he recognizes
my talent in the family.

112
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,560
Water!

113
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,760
What's going on?

114
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,200
Saw that! Just dialing
the number has brought the water.

115
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,680
This is called power!

116
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
The water stopped again!

117
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,400
Pappu! - Yes.

118
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,400
The water has stopped. - Am
I your servant to call so often?

119
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,960
Take that!

120
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,560
Mom. - Raj!

121
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,480
My son has arrived.

122
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,240
How are you, dear? - I'm fine.

123
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,480
How was your friend's marriage?
- His life has totally changed.

124
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,080
Your life will also change.
Just say yes to marriage!

125
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,280
Sister is right.
You should get married.

126
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm not going to
get trapped so soon.

127
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,160
Heard that! - Welcome home, Raj!

128
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
How are you, son?

129
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,560
Dad! - Live long.
How was your trip? - First class.

130
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
Good that you're here.
Do one thing.

131
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,760
Go to Singapore at once.

132
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,520
Find out why our ship
has not left from there yet?

133
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,760
The dealers here are pestering me.

134
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
Businessman!

135
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,680
What kind of a father are you?

136
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,440
The son has just arrived
and you're sending him out again!

137
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,520
You're always sending
this poor boy abroad. - Dad..

138
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,000
..we have to send someone.
- Then send someone else.

139
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,200
Pankaj, you go.

140
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
Then who'll handle the work here?

141
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,560
Have you brought the stuff? - Yes.

142
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,120
Come on! - What if we get caught..

143
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,640
Why are you scared? The
one who gets caught is the thief.

144
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,120
Sign language between
grandpa and grandson.

145
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,280
Something is surely wrong.

146
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,280
Come on, give me the stuff.

147
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,640
Grandpa, just one. - Of course!

148
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,160
Wow, sweets!

149
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,680
Sweet like your love
and soft like my heart.

150
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,080
Don't recite poetry. Eat quickly.

151
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,200
It's a risky affair.

152
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,960
You may close all doors
but I have the master key.

153
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,760
What is happening here? -
Sweets are being eaten in secret.

154
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,480
You have high diabetes. - Of 320!

155
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,440
Dad, it's a sin for
you to have sweets!

156
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,040
You take the medicines
and then the sweets too!

157
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,600
I get scolded for
eating the sweets. - Yes.

158
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,040
Dad, at least think about
us if not about your self.

159
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,480
Enough of it!

160
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,000
All of you are after a weak,
sick old man.

161
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,800
First ask,
why I have sent for sweets?

162
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,000
Why have you asked for sweets?

163
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,120
Why? - Raj has agreed.

164
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,200
Agreed?

165
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,720
For what? - For marriage!

166
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,720
What are you doing?

167
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,920
He is tired. Let him rest.

168
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,280
Let me talk to him.
I'll tell you everything.

169
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,200
Take these sweets
and celebrate. Go on!

170
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
What kind of a grandpa
are you? - Why?

171
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,640
You got me trapped
to save yourself.

172
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
What kind of a grandson are you?

173
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,720
Grandsons even give up their lives
to save their grandpa's honour.

174
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,360
You can't even
agree to get married.

175
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,240
Son, how will the Malhotra family
grow if you don't get married?

176
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,160
Ours is a very close knit family,
isn't it? - Yes.

177
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,280
There's so much love.

178
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,600
One wrong girl comes and
everything will go haywire.

179
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,400
Do you think I'll
get you an ordinary girl?

180
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,480
Still, I don't want
to get married. I'm sorry.

181
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,560
Sorry?

182
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,720
I'm also your grandpa!

183
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,480
I'll see to it
that you get married!

184
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,880
I'm also your grandson. Let go.

185
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,320
Open your mouth.

186
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,640
This doesn't mean I've
agreed to get married.

187
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,880
These sweets are
sugar free. Enjoy!

188
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

189
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,480
Please sit. - Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

190
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,240
Ms. Barucha! - Hi, handsome!

191
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
You look wonderful today.
- How many times have I told you?

192
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,520
Yes, if I had been married,
I'd be having two kids.

193
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,720
I'm still unmarried.

194
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,720
That's okay. Even I'm single.

195
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,960
And listen!

196
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,680
Until I find a good
and handsome boy like you,

197
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,760
I won't get married!

198
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,080
You shouldn't.

199
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
Okay? - Okay!

200
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,120
Hello. - Raj, this is Dr.
Balraj speaking.

201
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,680
Yes, doctor.

202
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Come to my nursing home immediately.
Your grandpa is a little sick.

203
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,800
Not little, but very much!

204
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,160
He's very sick!

205
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,080
He was fine this morning. - One can't
guarantee health at this age.

206
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,999
It can deteriorate any time.

207
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,280
All right, I'm coming. - Okay.

208
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,720
He's coming!

209
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,960
Hello? - Mom,
did doctor uncle call?

210
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,320
He was here.

211
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,719
He did grandpa's routine
check up and they went for a walk.

212
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,880
Why are you asking?

213
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,080
Nothing. Okay, bye.

214
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,400
Your acting should be realistic.

215
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,400
Don't worry, Kailash.

216
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,800
I used to win acting
competitions in college.

217
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,640
Grandpa! - Yes?
- Raj has arrived. Lie down.

218
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,760
Take this. - Come on..

219
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,320
Oh my god!

220
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,240
Your pulse is not getting
normal even after two injections.

221
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,800
What is bothering you so much?

222
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,360
You still have one
more year of life.

223
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,200
All wishes of a man
get fulfilled in a year.

224
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,800
What's the matter?

225
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,120
I will fulfill your wish.

226
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,480
I have only one wish.

227
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,520
I should see my great grandson.

228
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,120
Raj loves his freedom,
not his grandpa.

229
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,600
Open your eyes, Kailash.
Raj is here.

230
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,800
Raj, where are you?

231
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,120
I am here, grandpa. Wonderful!

232
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,200
You're wearing a suit
and lying on the hospital bed!

233
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,480
I had to lie down in an emergency.

234
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,000
You also had to act badly
in emergency. Isn't it?

235
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,680
Doctor, you too are a part of it?
- What could I do?

236
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Your grandpa forced me into it.

237
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,480
Grandpa, why do you do all this?

238
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,440
You know how valuable
you are to me.

239
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
I am valuable, right?

240
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,160
When are you coming
to select a girl? Answer me.

241
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,240
Whenever you say.

242
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,240
Priya, I think they've come.

243
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,760
Welcome, Mr. Malhotra!

244
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,840
Greetings, Mr. Kapoor.

245
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,160
Mr. Kapoor,
this is my grandson Raj.

246
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,320
Hello. - Hello.

247
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,800
You know Pappu. - Yes.

248
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,960
He's my son.

249
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,120
Greetings. - Live long.

250
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,000
He's the same guy I
had met at Suman's wedding.

251
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,840
I sensed the entire situation
when I saw you two there.

252
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,840
That's why we've
asked for this alliance.

253
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,080
I have already seen and
chosen your daughter. - Yes.

254
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,640
I wanted Raj to meet her.

255
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,400
Come, daughter.

256
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,360
Hello. - Hello.

257
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
Live long. Sit.

258
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,720
Yes.

259
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,720
Do you like her?

260
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,120
Grandpa,
doesn't she look a bit old?

261
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,840
What are you saying?
I've seen her horoscope.

262
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,280
Her age is perfect.

263
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,320
It seems grandpa has seen
the horoscope without his glasses.

264
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,920
Her cheeks are so plump.

265
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
That's the sign of beauty.

266
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,520
Have you seen her smile?
She looks so cute.

267
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,600
The one beside her looks better.

268
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,160
She's a mother of a baby.

269
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,920
Then she looks like a mother of 4.
Doesn't she?

270
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,920
What are you saying?
She doesn't look like!

271
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,160
Son, ask her anything
if you want to.

272
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,560
Yes. Ask her anything.

273
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,480
What are you educational
qualifications?

274
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
Me?

275
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,120
I've studied till 7th class.

276
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,920
She's a double graduate.
She knows all household chores.

277
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,000
She had prepared all these
savories, snacks and sweets.

278
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,240
It means she doesn't
know anything.

279
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,360
She knows so much.
What else do you want?

280
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,640
Why is he asking me questions?

281
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,920
He's still looking at you.

282
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,240
Get ready. He'll ask you again.

283
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,360
What are your hobbies?

284
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,840
Badminton, cricket, tennis, swimming,
music are her main hobbies.

285
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,760
It's her habit to praise others.

286
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,280
She is in fact a gold
medalist in Kabaddi.

287
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,320
Kabaddi?

288
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,880
Dear, even I want
to ask you something.

289
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,440
What is the most important
thing that keeps a family happy?

290
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Love.

291
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,560
If there is love among the family
members the home turns to heaven.

292
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,640
Wonderful!
She has such nice views.

293
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,120
What will we do with her views?
Ask her views.

294
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,320
Why do you want her
sister-in-law's views?

295
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
Sister-in-law? - Yes.

296
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,680
Quiet, dear.

297
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,160
Daughter-in-law,
your son was crying.

298
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
Take him. - Come!

299
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,080
Come, my son!

300
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,520
My pretty son!

301
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,200
Congratulations, Mr. Kapoor!

302
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,160
To you too. - Raj likes the girl!

303
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,960
The match is fixed from our side.

304
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,280
Fix the wedding date
as soon as possible.

305
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,760
Sure, why not.

306
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,720
Have some sweets. - Sure.

307
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,640
Priya.. - Raj..

308
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,760
Raj!

309
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,320
No, let her go. I'll hit you.

310
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,680
Search it, darling. Find the ring.

311
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,640
Doctor uncle, there is no difference
between love and photographs.

312
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,200
How? - Both are
developed in the dark.

313
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,560
Naughty guy!

314
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,680
Who has taken Raj's picture? Look!

315
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,200
Mom, I have taken this picture.

316
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,920
Raj had no clue I
was taking a picture.

317
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,880
It seems you two have
liked Switzerland a lot.

318
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,040
Why don't you two settle
down there for a few years?

319
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,480
Absolutely not!
They'll not go anywhere.

320
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,480
Now you want to send both son
and daughter-in-law abroad! No!

321
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,640
When I had sent you to Oxford
university, you had cried a lot.

322
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,800
Dad, you are..

323
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,920
Grandpa, you should have told me.

324
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,560
I'd have told the foreign minister
to open a branch of Oxford here.

325
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,200
Fool, you were not even born then.

326
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,560
That is the misfortune
of our country.

327
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,880
Raj, phone.

328
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,840
Hello?

329
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,120
All right. Hello, one second.

330
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,240
I'll call you later.

331
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,840
Whose call was it that
you had to go away and talk?

332
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,280
Raj, you are hiding something.

333
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,880
What's the matter?

334
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,680
You're right.

335
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,800
I thought I'd hide
this matter from you.

336
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,520
But such things can't be hidden.

337
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,680
What would you do if you knew..

338
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,560
..there's someone
else who share's my love?

339
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,280
I'll kill myself.

340
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,960
Raj, do you love someone else?

341
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,920
I don't.

342
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,200
I will start now. - What?

343
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,800
Doctor had called up.
The report is positive.

344
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,400
Priya, you're pregnant.

345
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,320
Raj!

346
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,560
What? I'm going to
be a great grandfather.

347
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,320
Have a long life!

348
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,960
Live long!

349
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,160
Bansi!

350
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,560
Yes! - Distribute
this among the poor.

351
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,800
Okay. - Daughter-in-law!

352
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,120
Asha! - Yes, dad.

353
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,560
Congratulations, daughter-in-law!
You're going to become a grandma!

354
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,560
I'll be a great grandpa!

355
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,720
I'm very happy today!

356
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,280
Chhotu!

357
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,800
God has heard my prayers.
Live long, dear.

358
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,280
Have a long life! - Ranjeet!

359
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,320
What is it, dad?
- You're going to get my position.

360
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,600
What? - You're going to be
a grandpa and me, a great grandpa.

361
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,560
Congratulations!

362
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,720
Pappu! - What?

363
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,680
I'll become a great uncle.
- I'll be great Pappu.

364
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,840
Grandpa, congratulations!

365
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,040
I've seen so much joy in this
house for the first time today.

366
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,840
All because of you.

367
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,400
Thank you. - Thanks to you.

368
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,360
Love you.

369
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,720
Kailash, congratulations!

370
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,840
Congratulations!

371
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,920
You'll remember me for this!
I've brought sweets today.

372
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,360
I'll have lots of it and
offer you too. - No, Balraj.

373
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,200
I won't have sweets anymore.

374
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,040
I want to live.

375
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,920
I don't need this stick.

376
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,360
My support is on his way!

377
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,320
I'll do everything
as you direct me to.

378
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,000
Cricket, tennis, jogging.

379
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,640
Chhotu, master is going
for a morning walk after years.

380
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,200
Without his stick!

381
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
This is daughter-in-law's magic.

382
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,120
I was very scared when I knew
I'd be married into your family.

383
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,520
Why?

384
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,520
I had seen your picture
in the newspapers.

385
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,520
I thought a person
with such big moustache..

386
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,960
..must be a dictator
and very strict.

387
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,800
I'd always have to put on a veil.

388
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,360
After coming here,
I found out you're very modern.

389
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,760
I feel you're not
Raj's but my grandpa.

390
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,400
Mom, this year we had a good crop
in our garden for the first time.

391
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,320
100 kilos of mangoes
have ripened on every tree!

392
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,320
Were you plucking
or weighing the mangoes?

393
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,720
Aunt, chocolate?
- Stop gossiping and do your work.

394
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,959
This will go to Mr.
Sharma. Put them in that basket.

395
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,320
Okay. - This is for Dr. Kumar.

396
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,800
Give it to me.
- Put it in that basket.

397
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,080
Take this. - What are you doing?

398
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,800
I have told you many times. Don't
lift heavy things in this condition.

399
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,280
Take out these raw mangoes.

400
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,720
Where had you been
early in the morning?

401
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,160
I went shopping. - For what?

402
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,559
Maharana Pratap's. - What?

403
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,160
I mean Maharana Pratap's
photograph. - Why?

404
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,399
Because a mother in
her 6th month of pregnancy..

405
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,600
..gets a baby with skills
of the one whom she sees the most.

406
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,080
If we hang Maharana
Pratap's picture..

407
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,080
..in Priya's room then the
baby will also be brave like him.

408
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,560
Have you gone crazy?

409
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,360
If the baby is like
Maharana Pratap..

410
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,880
..he'll be fighting
in jungles his entire life.

411
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,040
We should make
the baby a cricketer.

412
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,200
What will he do
by being a cricketer?

413
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,120
He'll uselessly get involved
in some match fixing.

414
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,360
We should make our
baby a politician..

415
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,040
..who can take the
entire country forward.

416
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,920
That's why in Priya's room..

417
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,440
What happened? Fallen asleep?

418
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,160
No, I'm thinking which politician's
photograph I should hang.

419
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,520
Shall I say something? - Go on.

420
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,480
Your problem can be solved.
- Really?

421
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,200
Hang a film hero's photograph
in daughter-in-law's room.

422
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,280
He can be a politician, a cricketer
and also Maharana Pratap.

423
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,480
Very simple!

424
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,320
It would've been better if you had
not spoken! Politician's photograph!

425
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,280
Maharana Pratap!

426
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,600
Sachin Tendulkar! - Politician!

427
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,800
Maharana Pratap!

428
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,800
Sachin Tendulkar!
- Why are you quarrelling?

429
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,320
Ask Priya whose picture
she wants to hang. - Yes!

430
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,640
Yes, dear, tell us.

431
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,880
Why are you worried about me?

432
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,520
I have already hung my
favorite photograph. - Whose?

433
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,080
Come on, brother!

434
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,600
Yes!

435
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,000
My god!

436
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,640
Four!

437
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,320
Ball please!

438
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,800
Come on, Pappu!

439
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,240
Pappu, well done!

440
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,920
Come on!

441
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,440
Buck-up, Pappu!

442
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,080
Come on, Pappu.

443
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,800
Very good! Come on!

444
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,440
My god!

445
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,600
Bansi, catch it! - Catch it!

446
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,720
I missed it!

447
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,960
Bansi, you fool!

448
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,080
You are out!

449
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,440
How can I be out, grandpa?
That was a six.

450
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,760
Decision's been given!

451
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,280
What is this?

452
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,360
Grandpa is cheating, mom.

453
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,680
It's not fair. - Not fair!

454
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,920
Boy, our family's rule is, the one
who crosses the boundary is out.

455
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,640
Give me the bat.
- So you want to bat?

456
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,200
Yes, I want to bat.
-Yes, you go bat.

457
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,360
I'll be the umpire. - You'll
be out on the very first ball.

458
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,640
Go on, you can't bowl me out!

459
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
Come on! - Come on, dad!

460
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,760
Hurry up! All the best, dad!

461
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,840
Come on bowl.

462
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,960
How's that? - Out!

463
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,080
You bowl so fast! It zoomed
past before I moved my bat!

464
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,200
I'm not out.

465
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,800
Tell him he's out.

466
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,480
Not out!

467
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,840
He's out! - What are you saying?

468
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,000
He is out! Dad is out!

469
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,760
Okay!

470
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,120
Out! - Yes!

471
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,560
You're not my friend
but a traitor.

472
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,280
What had we agreed upon?

473
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,680
What could I do? All of
them forced me to give you out.

474
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,520
What do you mean you were forced?

475
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,760
'Family match' fixing!

476
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,640
Very bad! I'll call the
sports minister and tell him now.

477
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,600
Forget it.

478
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,600
I won't bat. - It is my turn.

479
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,280
Yes, come on.
Everyone, take your positions.

480
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,840
Welcome, madam! - Thank you, dad!

481
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,800
Ready!

482
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,360
You don't know to play cricket and
you'll hang Tendulkar's photograph!

483
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,560
Now watch how I hit a six.
- Next ball.

484
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,960
Hit a six!

485
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,840
Bowl!

486
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,120
Six! -Come on, catch it! Catch it!

487
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,600
Priya!

488
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,040
Daughter-in-law!

489
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,160
Dear!

490
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,280
I don't understand anything.

491
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,640
It's been two hours. Why
are they not keeping us informed?

492
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,080
Balraj went in and
hasn't yet returned.

493
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
What happened, uncle?

494
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,760
Is everything okay?

495
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,520
Daughter-in-law had a miscarriage.

496
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,120
The baby passed away in the womb.

497
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,880
And Priya? - She is fine.

498
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Out of danger.

499
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,120
Thank god,
my daughter-in-law is safe.

500
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,240
Can we meet Priya? - No,
we have drugged Priya to sleep.

501
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,840
It won't be right to
disturb her for 7-8 hours.

502
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,960
I think all of us should go home.

503
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,960
No one has rested since
this accident occurred.

504
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,040
Come on, let's go. - You all go.

505
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,440
I'll stay here.

506
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,880
No, aunt.
Both of us will stay here.

507
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,560
Mom, I'll stay here.

508
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,080
But son.. - As soon as Priya
regains consciousness, I'll call you.

509
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,880
Yes, come on, everybody.

510
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,480
Kailash, you too come.

511
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,920
Losing baby is a
great shock to a mother.

512
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,760
Take care of Priya.
- Yes, grandpa.

513
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,080
Mr. Malhotra,
the doctor has called for you.

514
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,480
I'll be right back. Okay?

515
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,640
Come, Raj. Sit.

516
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,840
Dear..

517
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,520
I have hidden
something from you all.

518
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,040
What?

519
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,040
Priya's uterus was
damaged in the accident.

520
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,320
It had become septic.

521
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,480
To prevent further
infection the doctor..

522
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,920
..had to remove her
uterus and ovaries.

523
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,520
Priya can never conceive
again due to this.

524
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:43,080
Even the most modern and latest
technology can't help her now.

525
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,080
You have to conceal this matter
from everyone in the family.

526
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,480
If your grandpa
comes to know of it.

527
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,960
He's already had
two heart attacks.

528
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,960
He can't survive one more.

529
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,480
How can I tell this to Priya..

530
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,080
It's okay.

531
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,960
There's only one way
to lend courage to the family.

532
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,160
That we don't show our sorrow.

533
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,800
Shall we?

534
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,920
The kids have come.
I need no crying or regrets.

535
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,520
Everyone will behave
as if nothing has happened.

536
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,520
Understand? - Yes.

537
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,360
Get on your routine.

538
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,280
Welcome, children.

539
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,240
Our daughter-in-law has a long life.
I thought of her and here she is.

540
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,160
Live long.
Daughter-in-law, you'll see.

541
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,640
Within a year,
we'll have a newborn in our house.

542
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Priya!

543
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,800
Live long and have many children!

544
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,840
Enough.

545
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,800
No, Priya.

546
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,200
No, dear. Don't cry.

547
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,920
We shouldn't be sorry for
the one who was not even born.

548
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,480
Calm down, dear. - Miscarriage
is a very ordinary thing.

549
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,200
Even my friend had a miscarriage,
she now has 4 children.

550
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,040
4 children in the
age of family planning?

551
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,880
Pappu! - Yes?

552
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,760
Complain to the police
against her friend.

553
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,440
Police? I'll call the family planning
minister and have her arrested.

554
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,040
Her friend's husband
is the family minister.

555
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,480
How will you arrest her?

556
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,840
Call the prime minister!

557
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,640
Where can I find him?
Why are you laughing?

558
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,960
I can even call
up Bill Clinton. Yes!

559
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,680
What is happening?
Everyone is talking.

560
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,320
No one cares about daughter-in-law.
She has returned from the hospital.

561
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,160
Yes, Priya. Go and rest.

562
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,080
I'll prepare you
favorite food today.

563
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,920
Come, sister-in-law.
Bring the groceries, Pappu.

564
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,520
Of course. - Aren't you
going to office? - Yes, Pankaj.

565
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,280
Yes, there's so much work left.
- Daughter-in-law.

566
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,920
Go to your room and rest.

567
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,480
Raj, take her.

568
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,040
What happened?

569
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,200
Have you looked into the
eyes of your family members?

570
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,480
There's a hope in their eyes that
soon I'll give an heir to this house.

571
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,280
One day they will get to
know that we have cheated them.

572
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,720
What will happen then?
- Don't worry about that.

573
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,720
I've thought of something.
What do you think?

574
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,560
We'll adopt a small, cute baby.

575
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,400
Daddy always tells us to
go abroad to handle the business.

576
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,320
If you want, we'll go abroad
for a few years and adopt a child.

577
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,680
Okay?

578
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'll explain to doctor uncle.

579
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,000
What other option do we have?

580
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,360
Grandpa.

581
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,720
Come, dear.

582
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,960
Greetings. - Live long.

583
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,120
Come, sit.

584
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,360
Were you crying? - No.

585
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,600
These are tears of joy.

586
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,320
I dozed off reading
the newspaper..

587
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,840
..and had a pretty dream.

588
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,000
That I've become
a great grandfather.

589
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:04,880
I saw a small baby
playing on my lap giggling.

590
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,000
Exactly like Raj!
The same eyes, the same smile.

591
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,360
As soon as I lowered
my head to kiss him..

592
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,320
..the naughty boy
grabbed my moustache.

593
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,880
My eyes were filled
with tears of joy.

594
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,960
Early morning dream
always comes true.

595
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,640
Hail the lord!

596
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,720
Thank you, my love.

597
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,960
Raj! - Yes.

598
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,480
If I ask for something from you,
will you give it to me?

599
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,400
Why ask? Everything is yours.

600
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,720
What if I want to give
away that which is mine?

601
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,440
Go ahead. What's the problem?

602
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,680
You should remarry.

603
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,120
What? - Today grandpa saw a dream.

604
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,120
A small baby, just like you,
was playing on his lap.

605
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,960
He doesn't want someone
else's but your own child.

606
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,600
How can we play
with his sentiments..

607
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,840
..calling an adopted
baby as our own child?

608
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,040
Raj, I am infertile.

609
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,600
I can't become a mother
but you can be a father.

610
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,800
Please, Raj.

611
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,560
Would you remarry..

612
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,520
..if I had met
the same fate as you?

613
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,400
Look..

614
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,360
Everything is going to
be perfectly okay. I love you.

615
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,280
Yes, Priya.
- Raj, I want to meet you at once.

616
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,320
Why? What is it?

617
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,160
I can't tell you over the phone.
Do one thing.

618
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,880
I'll reach India gate.
You come there.

619
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,960
All right. I'll be there.

620
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,640
What is it?
Why did you call me here?

621
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,440
Read this news.

622
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,640
Surrogate mother!

623
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,360
The girl was lucky to have a child
even though she couldn't conceive.

624
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,160
The only difference was that
the womb belonged to someone else.

625
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,680
You mean a test tube baby!

626
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,560
No, our family is so famous that..

627
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,440
..the matter of a test
tube baby can't be hidden.

628
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,040
It means you want me to..
- Yes, Raj.

629
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,280
We should find a girl
who can give birth to our baby.

630
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,920
If I needed someone else
to give birth to my baby..

631
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
..why would I refuse to remarry?

632
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,520
Why would I talk
of adopting a child?

633
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,360
As I love you very much
and I don't want to share it.

634
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,200
You get sorrows for free but..

635
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,360
..you have to pay a price for joy.

636
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,440
I'm ready to share your love
with another woman for my child.

637
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,560
Priya, even if I listen to you,
where will we find such a girl?

638
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,200
If I am destined to be a mother,
we will find someone.

639
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,680
Hi, handsome!

640
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,560
The foreign marketing
deal we're doing..

641
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,680
..with your N.
R. I friend, Ajay Sharma..

642
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,800
'Will she help me?'

643
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,920
This is your air ticket to Mumbai.

644
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,440
What happened? You look disturbed.

645
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,760
Nothing, Ms. Barucha. Sit down.

646
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,000
There's a problem.
- Tell me your problem.

647
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,000
I'll solve your problem easily.

648
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,880
Ms. Barucha, this problem
won't get solved easily.

649
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,920
It will take at least nine months.

650
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,040
What? - Yes.

651
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,160
I have a friend who needs a girl.
- Really?

652
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,720
Is he handsome like you?

653
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,560
He is handsome and rich.

654
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,720
He is ready to give everything.
House, car, bungalow, everything.

655
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,160
All he needs is a baby.

656
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,280
Let the wedding take place.

657
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,400
I'll give him as many
children as he wants.

658
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,280
The problem is that
he is already married.

659
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,240
He doesn't want to remarry.

660
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,240
What? A child out of wedlock?

661
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,080
Is there a problem?
- What nonsense!

662
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,760
You have misunderstood me.
Am I a lowly girl?

663
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,920
Ms. Barucha,
you've misunderstood me!

664
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,280
I'm not that sort of a boy.

665
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,400
I was just discussing
my friend's problem with you.

666
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,280
To hell with your
friend and his problem!

667
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,680
My body and soul belongs
to my husband! Understand?

668
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,040
What idiot friends he
has who have such problems!

669
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,120
Thank you.

670
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,560
Congratulations, Raj.

671
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,280
Until now, we were just friends.

672
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,240
Now we're business partners.

673
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,360
Thank you.

674
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,320
Mrs. Kapoor. - Thank you, sir.

675
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,600
First of all, let me congratulate
Mr. Raj Malhotra and Mr. Ajay Sharma.

676
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,600
We're glad to announce that Mr.
Ajay Sharma's company..

677
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,520
..will market all of Mr.
Raj Malhotra's products in Europe.

678
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,560
I request Mr.
Raj Malhotra to tell us which..

679
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,760
..product should
be launched first..

680
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,040
'Will she help me? '

681
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,360
Mr. Raj,
I know about your problem.

682
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,040
I am ready to help you.

683
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,640
Thank you, you are very nice.
- It's my honour.

684
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,360
Priya will be very
happy to hear this.

685
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,600
Raj, Mrs. Kapoor is asking
your opinion about your product.

686
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,440
Sir, I was asking which
product to launch first.

687
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,320
I'm sorry. I was lost somewhere.

688
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,560
Can we discuss this
in the next meeting?

689
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,800
Sure. Why not?

690
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,000
I'm missing my wife
a bit too much today.

691
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,800
Excuse me, sorry. Bye.

692
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,000
See you later, brother. - Yes.

693
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,280
Where do you want to go?
- Straight ahead.

694
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,480
Turn left from here.

695
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,600
Stop here.

696
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,760
Your house is..
I can see nothing here.

697
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,080
Why do you need a house? Come on!

698
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,920
What!? - It's an AC car.
We'll have fun.

699
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,880
I charge rs.1000 for a night.

700
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,040
You can pay a little less. C'mon.

701
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,560
You've been mistaken.
I saw you and I gave you a lift.

702
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,080
I was about to drop you home.

703
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,080
Meaning? - I mean..

704
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,440
I have a different problem.

705
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,840
I have a friend. He needs a girl
who would stay with him for a year.

706
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,760
For a year?

707
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,240
Rascal! You are a wolf
under a sheep's skin.

708
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,160
This is your story
not your friend's, right?

709
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,800
Yes. - Look, Mister.

710
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,080
I have got two lives
to take care of.

711
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,160
They have no father to
look after them. So I can't come.

712
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,800
But there's a girl
who dances at Deepa Bar.

713
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,880
You should meet her.
Her name is Madhubala.

714
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,160
Your job will be done. Go on.

715
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,200
I'll call her up. - Thank you.

716
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,200
One second. Take this.

717
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,480
You haven't touched me,
yet you offer money.

718
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,360
This is not for you
but for your children.

719
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,040
I'll pray that
your work gets done.

720
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,160
Thank you.

721
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,160
Entice that rich guy.

722
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,600
You, want to have fun?

723
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,960
No.

724
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,080
Wait!

725
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,920
Madhubala, get me the money.

726
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,480
They showered money on you.

727
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,640
Where's the rest of it?

728
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,920
What are you talking about?
- You'd or should I help?

729
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,240
Don't touch. - C'mon, bring it.

730
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,680
Here!

731
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,920
Here's your commission.

732
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,040
Hey Mina! Get going!

733
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm going. He's a jerk!

734
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,680
Come, dear.
Wonder where they come from!

735
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,240
I got a call from
Vyjanti that you'll come.

736
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,760
What's it?

737
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,280
Didn't she tell you?

738
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,240
Madhubala, coming?

739
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,560
C'mon get going!

740
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,640
You're throwing attitude today!

741
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,040
You'd mind leaving now!

742
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,240
Yes, boss?

743
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,880
We won't be able to talk here.
Shall we go somewhere else?

744
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,200
That's going to cost even more.

745
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,720
Alright.

746
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,840
Let's go.

747
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,840
Come.

748
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,320
Boss, why here?

749
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,400
Come to Chandni.
There are many customers there.

750
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,120
One gets everything that's
needed for free, besides the room.

751
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,280
My room's here.

752
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,720
Oh! - Come.
- Seem to be very rich!

753
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,760
Get to the lift. I'll get the key.

754
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,400
Good evening.

755
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,040
Why do these sandals get loose?
Damn it!

756
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,120
You fool!
Why are you showing your teeth?

757
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,080
Are they new? Fatso!

758
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,720
Shall we?

759
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,240
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

760
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,400
Sir, don't tip him.

761
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,000
Madam is very generous.

762
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,640
Is it? He's very cunning.

763
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,600
Give him the tip.

764
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,960
Take. - Thank you, sir.

765
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,360
Fatso, half of it is mine. - Okay.

766
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,600
Come on.

767
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,720
What a big room!

768
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,520
I had heard big
hotels had big rooms.

769
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,720
Sir, this is so big.
They even have TV.

770
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,560
Is it yours?
- No, it belongs to the hotel.

771
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,080
Do you want to watch? - Yes.

772
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,080
Is this a mobile phone?
- No, this is remote control.

773
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,200
Madhubala!

774
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,280
I forgot.
- There is need for that.

775
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,080
Why? You're not in the right mood?

776
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,000
No, I want to talk to you.

777
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,720
You.. - I'll charge
you double for that.

778
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,640
I was just joking!

779
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,960
Sit down!

780
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,160
Now I don't need to
talk to you about price.

781
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,480
I take a lot of money when
I go out. I charge 700-800 rupees!

782
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,280
You brought me to a good place.
Spoke nicely.

783
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,160
You're handsome.
I'll charge you extra.

784
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,960
I'll take 1,000 rupees.

785
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,000
All right, how much
will you charge for a week?

786
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,760
3,000!

787
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,480
For a month?

788
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,960
Do you like me so much?

789
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,240
Even I like you a lot.

790
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,080
Okay, give me 15,000 for a month.

791
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,680
For a year? - A year!

792
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,160
That would be too much.
I'm not that good in math.

793
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,640
20,25,35.

794
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,040
That would be a 100,000!

795
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,000
How much is it?

796
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,560
200,000!

797
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,680
200,000!?

798
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,920
I haven't seen
so much money before.

799
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,680
Sir, I won't do anything kinky.

800
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:22,000
Don't worry, I am married
and I love my wife very much.

801
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,760
It shows.

802
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,240
We have everything.
We don't have a child.

803
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,200
I need a baby from you. - Baby?

804
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,320
Why? Can't your wife have babies?

805
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,400
I can't stop laughing!

806
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,680
Why did you come to me?

807
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,000
I need a baby from you.

808
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,480
I am ready to pay
whatever amount you ask.

809
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,840
How much can you pay?

810
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,320
Half a million! A million!

811
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,560
Hello?

812
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,880
Million! - What happened?

813
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,960
Are you okay? - A million!

814
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,240
What happened?

815
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,960
You will pay me a million
in return for a child?

816
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,759
Will you dump me after I conceive?

817
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:22,559
I can give you the money
right now. - I trust you.

818
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,440
What will the world
say if you give your wife..

819
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:28,719
..the baby of a
street girl like me?

820
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,560
The world will speak
only if it knows anything.

821
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,920
All right, everything in secret?

822
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:40,880
My hard earned money! Boss, it's amazing.
I used to earn for my stomach.

823
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:44,239
Now my stomach's
going to earn for me?!

824
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,759
Boss, I have only
one principle in life.

825
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:52,799
I never kiss on lips. Okay?

826
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,120
Okay.

827
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,440
A million!

828
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,160
Hello!

829
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,200
Priya! - Hi,
I was waiting for your call.

830
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:11,200
I have found a girl
who'll give you a baby.

831
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,840
Really?

832
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,280
Yes.

833
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,080
She must be an angel.

834
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,520
She must be a good
person to help us.

835
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,560
One million!

836
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:27,439
She is good.

837
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,200
Priya.. - I understand.

838
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,320
She is from a poor family, right?

839
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,320
Priya, she is..

840
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,280
It is enough if
she is well-cultured.

841
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,040
One million! Hi!

842
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,280
My hard earned money!

843
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:45,999
I love you, Priya.
- I love you too.

844
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,520
Bye.

845
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,280
Buy some good clothes
for yourself tomorrow.

846
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:57,960
Take this 50,000.

847
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,200
Buy clothes that cover your body.

848
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,280
Why? Don't you like my body?

849
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,240
Nice body! But keep it covered.

850
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,680
Okay.

851
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,680
Tell your family that
you'll be with me for a year.

852
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:17,000
I don't have anyone
in this world except you.

853
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,160
All right, go to sleep.
- Come on, I'm ready.

854
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,240
No, you sleep here.
I'll sleep there.

855
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,240
What?

856
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,800
You sleep here. I'll sleep there.

857
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,440
No! I need my million quickly!

858
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,600
No. - My million!

859
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,720
You'll get it. Go to sleep.

860
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,720
I don't know when I'll get it!

861
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,520
Oh god!

862
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,760
Excuse me. - How much for this?

863
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,000
It's not meant for you.

864
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,760
Speak in Hindi.
- It is not for you.

865
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,080
Why? Is the material
bad or the color?

866
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,920
It is expensive.
You can't afford it.

867
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,080
What are you saying?
Look I have money!

868
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,280
Come on, go out.

869
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,360
Why should I go out?
I have the money.

870
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,800
I have come to buy clothes.
- I told you once.

871
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,000
Go out. Please!

872
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,080
Get out!

873
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,400
How dare you scold me!
To hell with you!

874
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,040
Do you think I'm a lowly girl?
I can buy your entire shop!

875
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,960
Understand? - We neither want
to sell the shop nor the goods.

876
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,400
Only decent people come here.
Get out!

877
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,720
You scoundrel! Do these decent
people give you special money?

878
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,040
Watchman! - Yes, sir.

879
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,320
Don't touch me!

880
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,600
Do you think I'm that cheap?

881
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,200
You rascal! I won't spare you!

882
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,040
You have such a big shop
but have no manners at all.

883
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,680
The lowly rascal!

884
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,160
Move!

885
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,080
The scoundrel scolded me!

886
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,480
I won't spare the rascal!

887
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,520
He kicked me out of the shop!

888
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,120
He thinks every well
dressed person is decent!

889
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,800
Excuse me, madam. - What?

890
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,560
Where are you going? - Upstairs.

891
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,160
Why do you ask?
- I am the general manager.

892
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,560
Who do you want to meet?
- That sir!

893
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,840
Which sir?
- The fair guy with big eyes.

894
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,560
He brought me here last night.

895
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,680
His room is upstairs.
- Room number?

896
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,960
I don't know the number.

897
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
The room with a view of the ocean.

898
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,280
We have many rooms
with a view of the ocean.

899
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,960
Come with me.
I'll show you. - Excuse me, madam.

900
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,520
You can't go upstairs.
- Baldy, you are misbehaving now!

901
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,560
If he finds out, you'll be sacked.

902
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,680
Madam, you'll have to
get out of the hotel. Please.

903
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,560
Ladies like you can't
enter our hotel. Get out!

904
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,720
Let me go! - Come on. Out!

905
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,880
Let go of my hand. - That's all.

906
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,880
Hey fatso. Come here! - Good
morning, madam. - He knows me.

907
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,240
Tell this fool that you know me.

908
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,840
You know her? - Yes, sir.

909
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,280
Why wouldn't he?
He took me upstairs.

910
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,440
You?

911
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:57,080
Sir, she was with Raj Malhotra.
- Raj Malhotra?

912
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,760
Excuse me, madam.
I was not on duty last night.

913
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,240
That's why I made a mistake.

914
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,880
I'm quite sure you'll
forgive my small mistake.

915
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,520
I'm quite sure you won't tell Mr.
Raj about this.

916
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,200
Who is Mr. Raj? - Raj Malhotra!

917
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,560
The person that brought you here!

918
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,800
My young man's
name is Raj Malhotra?

919
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,200
Will you come with me? - No.

920
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,760
Let's go. What are you staring at?

921
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,240
Where is my young man?

922
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,560
Food for expecting mothers
will be the first product..

923
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,680
..to be launched in
the international market.

924
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,480
My friend and business partner,
Ajay Sharma..

925
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:38,040
..will promote it through
his American companies.

926
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,480
I'll provide him with all the..

927
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,680
..technical help he needs.
- Yes, thanks.

928
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,920
Mr. Sinha. - Yes, sir!

929
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,560
Our product has good
prospects in Europe's markets.

930
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,160
Sir!

931
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,520
Come here!

932
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,280
Excuse me.

933
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:04,120
Sir, the money you gave,
the shopkeeper said..

934
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,040
..he won't give clothes
to girls like me.

935
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,440
Go upstairs, I'm coming.

936
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,560
No, I'll eat with you.

937
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,920
Go upstairs and order.

938
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,480
Rascal, you can eat with
these loafers but can't offer me?

939
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,000
Who is she?

940
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,800
I am sorry. Please forgive me.

941
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,600
Sorry. - It's okay.

942
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,440
Please, Mr. Sinha. - Yes, sir.

943
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,680
In the market survey report..

944
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,600
Raj, who is she?

945
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,360
A friend.

946
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,920
That she is. Is she a call girl?

947
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,120
She's a good girl.

948
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:45,280
That she is,
but she's a call girl, right?

949
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,960
Who doesn't do business? You, me.

950
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,400
Everybody. - You're right.

951
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,360
Why did you come downstairs?

952
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,840
What was so important that you
had to disturb me at the meeting?

953
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,720
If you are ashamed of me,
why didn't you tell me before?

954
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,520
You could have locked
me in the bathroom.

955
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,400
Even that shopkeeper insulted me!

956
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,520
He said he won't sell
clothes to a girl like me.

957
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,600
Why are you staring like this?
I don't get angry with food.

958
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,800
If you want, take it.
- I don't need it.

959
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,800
Which shopkeeper? - That
big shopkeeper across the road.

960
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,160
What did he say? - I told you.

961
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,280
He disgraced me and now you too.

962
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:32,640
I am sorry. I forgot you've
come from another world.

963
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,200
I didn't come here.
You brought me into your world!

964
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,040
Use this.

965
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,720
Hold it.

966
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,880
Come with me. - Where?

967
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,600
To buy clothes
from that very shop.

968
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,600
I won't go there.

969
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,040
Madhubala.. Ms. Madhubala.

970
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,880
What happened? - For the
first time, someone talked so..

971
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,200
..respectfully to me.

972
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,200
Come on!

973
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,320
Let's go. Come.

974
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,320
Mr. Bhatia's bill..

975
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,480
You've come here again!

976
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,800
I've brought her here.

977
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,400
You.. - Raj Malhotra.

978
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,880
Raj Malhotra?

979
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,640
Mr. Malhotra! I can't believe it!

980
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:33,080
It's an honour that
you've come here to shop.

981
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,440
She has come here to shop.

982
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,040
She has come with you? Sure!

983
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,240
Jessy! Rita!
Seema! Attend to madam.

984
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,600
No, you will attend her. - Sure!

985
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,280
Come, madam.

986
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,400
Go, madam! - Please come!

987
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,560
Take this, madam. - No.

988
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,200
Have this drink, madam.
I've brought it for you.

989
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,720
Go through the dresses while I arrange
good shoes and sandals for you.

990
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,000
Kalpana, for madam.. - You get it!

991
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,160
Come on. Hurry up. - Yes!

992
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,480
Try this. Do you like this?

993
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:06,960
No?

994
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,800
Okay.

995
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,000
I had thought I'd
buy your entire shop.

996
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,400
Your shop contains
nothing which suits her.

997
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,920
Did you like anything? - No.

998
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,840
Shall we go to some
other big shop? Let's go.

999
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,320
Sorry. - You are hot tempered.

1000
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,600
Have cold drink.

1001
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,920
Old man!
- Don't do this in future.

1002
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:28,960
Yes.

1003
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,880
What are you doing?
- Smoking is injurious to health.

1004
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,640
Even this.
- Sir, this is a small bottle.

1005
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,280
A small bottle makes a large
hole in your liver. Give it to me.

1006
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:54,560
Madhu, my wife shouldn't
know who you are.

1007
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,640
Okay?

1008
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,920
Okay.

1009
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,440
What are you doing?
Are you going to make me bald?

1010
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,720
It's okay. Don't worry.

1011
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,680
Madhu! Priya!

1012
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,640
Madhu! How will I repay your debt?

1013
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,920
Forget it!
It's between two ladies.

1014
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,280
Only a woman can understand
a woman's sorrow.

1015
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,200
Was that good?

1016
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,200
Very good. But be polite.

1017
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,040
That is okay.
When will we meet Priya madam?

1018
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,120
We're going to
Switzerland tomorrow.

1019
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,600
You'll meet her at
Delhi airport. Okay?

1020
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,600
Until then rehearse
it over and over.

1021
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,080
Okay? - With love!

1022
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,560
Only a woman can understand
a woman's sorrow.

1023
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,400
Is that okay?

1024
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,640
Bansi, hurry up or else they'll
miss the plane! - Yes, hurry up!

1025
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,640
Live long.

1026
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,240
Call me up and take care. - Yes.

1027
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,080
All the best, son.
Have a good flight?

1028
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,520
I have called our Zurich office.
The driver will come to receive you.

1029
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,680
Yes. - All the best.

1030
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,080
If the driver doesn't show up,
I'll call the pilot. - Dear, come here.

1031
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,640
Take this sacred thread.

1032
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,280
As soon as you conceive, put
it on. It will protect the baby.

1033
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,000
Yes. - Live long.

1034
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,320
Live long. Take care.

1035
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,520
Don't worry.

1036
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,440
I'll manage everything here. Okay?

1037
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,240
Thank you, doctor.
- God bless you.

1038
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,400
All right, Pappu. - Call
me if Raj doesn't look after you.

1039
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,840
Live long, dear.

1040
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,600
Take care of her. - Yes.

1041
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,000
Best of luck. - Thank you.

1042
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,880
Bye, son. - Shall we leave?

1043
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,120
Bye. - Bye!

1044
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,920
Bye. - Bye.

1045
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,640
Raj, where is she?

1046
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,560
I told her to meet here.

1047
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,120
Priya!

1048
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,600
Madhu.

1049
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,520
Come.

1050
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,360
Madhu, this is Priya.

1051
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,960
Hi. - Hi.

1052
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,480
I don't know what to tell you.

1053
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:39,840
I can't even thank
you for such a big favor.

1054
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,960
It's all right.

1055
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,680
Only a woman can understand
a woman's sorrow.

1056
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,560
Come, Madhu.

1057
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,800
Hi, Priya! - Hi!

1058
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,240
Oh my god!
This is my cousin and his wife.

1059
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,680
Welcome to Switzerland, sister!
- Hi, brother Vicky.

1060
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:08,800
How are you? - How are you?

1061
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,240
Hello, Raj. How are you? - Nice to see you.
- Welcome to Switzerland.

1062
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,360
Hello. - Hello.

1063
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,840
This is Madhu.
She was with us in our flight.

1064
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,640
She lives here. - All right.

1065
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,520
I called your dad yesterday and
he said you're coming here today.

1066
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,480
So I've come to pick you all up.
You guys have to stay in my house.

1067
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,240
Last time you came for honeymoon
and I didn't disturb you.

1068
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,280
You'll have to stay
with me this time.

1069
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,600
We have to stay away
this time as well.

1070
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,360
As the office is
close to the bungalow.

1071
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,120
I have lots of work. - All right.

1072
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,960
My baby's tonsure ceremony will
be held during a holy festival.

1073
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,680
You two have to say
with us for a week.

1074
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,040
You have to stay with us!

1075
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,960
Come, I'll drop you.
- No, my car has arrived.

1076
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,480
All right.
I'll drop you to the car. Come.

1077
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,320
Please come.

1078
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,560
Madhu, this is our house.
We'll stay here.

1079
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,520
Wow! A house amidst the hills.

1080
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,840
I am shaken after seeing this.

1081
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,000
I've melted after seeing the snow!
And how's that?

1082
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,200
Come on. Let's go out.

1083
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,960
Teacher,
have you taught her all this?

1084
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,400
I tried a little.

1085
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,400
No problem.
I'll teach her the rest.

1086
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,640
Madhu, come in.

1087
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,360
What do you think of the house?
- It is very nice.

1088
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,240
This is my room.

1089
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,040
This is yours.

1090
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,320
Madam!

1091
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,240
Madam, this coat has got stuck.
- Let me take it out for you.

1092
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,040
Call me Priya.

1093
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,240
My god! How can I take your name?

1094
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,000
The way I take yours.

1095
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,240
There's no sir
or madam here. Okay?

1096
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,960
My god! Such a big
swimming pool in your room!

1097
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,680
You can swim whenever you want.

1098
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:54,440
If you like it then you stay here.
I'll go to your room.

1099
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,920
Okay? - Okay.

1100
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,160
I'll get my luggage.

1101
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,360
Madhu liked this room
so I gave it to her.

1102
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,480
I'll stay in the guest room.
- It's okay.

1103
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,320
We've already seen this room.

1104
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,840
Let's see the guest room. - Come.

1105
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,720
Not like this.

1106
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,880
I'll take you to the guest room the
way I had brought you to this room.

1107
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,440
This is my room.

1108
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,640
The one there is yours.

1109
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,840
I know. But my wife is here.

1110
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,440
You belong to me. Don't you?

1111
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,840
Oh god!

1112
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,600
Fruit, vegetables, groceries,
clothes, shoes, all in one shop.

1113
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,400
Yes. Madhu,
take whatever you want.

1114
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,520
Yes.

1115
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,280
Wine shop!

1116
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,120
Attention please.

1117
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:22,640
Since there's a weather forecast
of heavy snow fall this evening..

1118
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,920
..we'll be closing
the shop in half an hour.

1119
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,200
Listen, Madhu.

1120
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,120
It was just announced that
there will be heavy snowfall here.

1121
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,760
All roads will get blocked.

1122
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,880
Raj will pick us up in some time.

1123
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,280
You have to do one thing.

1124
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,200
Did you understand
what you have to do?

1125
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,200
Have you bought groceries
for the entire year?

1126
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,600
Where is Priya?
Is she still shopping?

1127
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,000
She left an hour ago. - What?

1128
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,240
Doesn't she know there's going
to be a snow storm? - She knows.

1129
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,920
She had to buy some things from
around the house. So she left.

1130
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,840
She must have reached home by now.
- Come on, put the trolley there.

1131
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,600
I'll do it.

1132
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,160
From that side.

1133
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,880
Hello.

1134
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,600
Do you speak English? - Yes, sir.

1135
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,800
Could you tell me if there
is an Indian girl in your store?

1136
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,960
Her name is Priya.

1137
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,600
Sorry, sir. The shop is closed.

1138
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,520
There is no customer.
- All right. Thank you.

1139
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,640
Welcome.

1140
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,240
Madhu, the phone is ringing.

1141
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,320
Hello. Yes, Priya.

1142
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,560
Where are you?

1143
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,200
In the church.

1144
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,560
All right, stay there.
I'll pick you up.

1145
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,920
How can you come? All roads are
blocked because of the snowfall.

1146
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,720
Don't worry about me. There
are many people with me here.

1147
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,120
I'll come as soon
as the road clears up.

1148
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,400
You have blocked the roads.

1149
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,200
You can say that.

1150
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:43,440
If you two are not left alone,
how will we achieve our goal?

1151
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,960
I love you.

1152
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,240
I love you too.

1153
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:22,520
Sorry. I mixed a little
vodka with the cold drink.

1154
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,480
It's too cold outside.
That's why..

1155
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,120
Madhu.

1156
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,480
I love my wife very much.

1157
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,360
I..

1158
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:39,080
Congratulations. Good news.
She is expecting.

1159
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,360
Congratulations.

1160
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,120
Priya you have become a mother.

1161
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,160
She has become mother.

1162
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,400
Ten lakhs.

1163
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,320
Ten lakhs?

1164
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,120
Congrats, Raj. Congrats.

1165
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,720
Bless daughter-in-law
in our behalf.

1166
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,880
And look, come here on the
first available flight.

1167
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,400
No, grandpa, this is not possible.

1168
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:11,520
Because the doctor has prohibited
from talking long flights.

1169
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:15,360
All right, don't come. Don't
come with daughter-in-law.

1170
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,560
But take care of daughter-in-law
there.

1171
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,720
What is happening there?

1172
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,680
Take, talk with your mother.

1173
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,600
Son Raj.
- Yes, mother.

1174
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,800
Congrats. Live long. May
God give you my age.

1175
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,000
Give the phone to daughter-in-law.

1176
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,600
I won't.
- Give. - one second. - Hello.

1177
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:32,920
Live long dear. Stay happy.
Don't pick up any heavy load.

1178
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,560
Yes.

1179
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:38,040
And the tie the sacred
thread I gave you.

1180
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,920
Okay, mother.

1181
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,560
Talk with father.

1182
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,560
Hello.

1183
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:48,040
Congratulations. No, do
as the doctor says.

1184
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,800
All right.
- And take care of daughter-in-law.

1185
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:53,360
Okay. - Okay, son bye. God
bless you. Bye. Bye. Bye.

1186
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,440
Give me the phone.
- Congrats. - You hung up.

1187
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:16,880
Madhu. Madhu.
- What is this?

1188
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,360
It contains flowers
offered to God.

1189
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,360
Mother has given them to me
for the baby's protection.

1190
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:27,840
Always wear it. This will
protect the baby.

1191
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,400
Priya.
- Yes.

1192
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:07,760
Priya, it is 3 months. My belly
has not inflated till now.

1193
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:15,200
Madhu the belly comes
out after 5, 6 months.

1194
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,760
Even I was worried like you when
I was expecting last year.

1195
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:26,280
Mother-in-law! They are
very dangerous, right?

1196
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,440
No, my mother-in-law is not
like that. She is very nice.

1197
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,920
She loves me a lot.
And Raj's grandpa.

1198
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,760
He considers me his grand daughter
and not daughter-in-law.

1199
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,320
Who else is there in your family?

1200
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,840
There is a doctor grandpa
who is grandpa's friend.

1201
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:43,520
There is an uncle and an aunt.
And Pappu brother.

1202
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,360
His contacts are so bad that
if a phone develops trouble..

1203
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:51,000
..he will all the telecom minister
instead of a mechanic.

1204
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:55,800
And every new person thinks wrong
with his habit of winking.

1205
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,160
You must be having great fun
in your in-laws house.

1206
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,760
You might not know when
the day passes.

1207
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,800
It was like that before.
But since I..

1208
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,440
But those days will come
again thanks to you.

1209
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,840
Congrats Raj, our company has
crossed the mark of 10 millions.

1210
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:23,480
This is nothing it will cross
further 100 billion. - Yes.

1211
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,080
Hi Ajay. - Hello, sister-in-law.
How are you? - I am fine.

1212
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,600
This is my friend, Madhu.
- Hi. - And he is Ajay.

1213
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,760
Raj's friend and business partner.
- Hello.

1214
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,200
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen.

1215
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,240
Today I stand here
in front of you..

1216
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:43,600
..to launch a new product
of my company, our company.

1217
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,800
Its called cosmetics of India.

1218
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,840
And the person who is
going to launch..

1219
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,160
..this product for us today is a
very important part of my life.

1220
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,480
Come Madhu.

1221
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,600
Yes, Madhu. You are
our V.I.P. Come on.

1222
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:10,360
Please come.
- Thanks. Thank you.

1223
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:20,000
Hey Seth, come here.

1224
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,440
Are you guys having a good time?
- Congrats.

1225
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,600
Priya.

1226
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,880
Raj, Vicky brother has arrived.
- Excuse me.

1227
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,120
Congratulations Priya.
Congratulations.

1228
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,440
Congratulations Raj.
- Thank you.

1229
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,600
Brother,
sister-in-law has not come.

1230
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,040
She is busy because it
is my son's shaving..

1231
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,560
..ceremony the day after.
But I have come.

1232
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,360
I have to come to invite on
my son's shaving ceremony.

1233
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,480
Okay.

1234
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:56,960
Hello. - Hi. - I was thinking
where I have seen you.

1235
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:00,440
Strange. You have changed so much.

1236
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,080
No one can see you and say
that you're a prostitute.

1237
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,280
Who told you?

1238
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,560
I and Raj never had any secrets.

1239
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,840
Even I like good things.

1240
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:25,720
If it is good I don't
care about money.

1241
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,920
Come as soon as you
are over with Raj.

1242
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:33,200
I will give you double the
money Raj is giving you.

1243
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:40,080
Okay.

1244
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:41,760
Okay.

1245
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:49,840
Excuse me, I will catch you later.

1246
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,120
Why have you come here after
leaving the party?

1247
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,520
I don't want to stay here.
I am going back.

1248
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:09,760
Why what happened? Did anyone
tell you anything?

1249
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,320
All you rich people are the same?

1250
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:14,480
You play so many games
for your selfish means.

1251
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,880
First you gave me so much respect.

1252
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,480
And then you insulted me
so badly with one shock.

1253
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,280
You needed a baby I could have
given birth one in the road.

1254
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,200
What was the need to make
me suit your society?

1255
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:30,240
When you had to tell your friends
that I am a prostitute.

1256
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:40,080
I didn't feel so cheap when I used
to go whoring as I did today.

1257
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,280
Did Ajay tell you anything?

1258
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:46,960
Madhu, I have not told
anyone anything.

1259
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,640
When you came to the Mumbai
conference that day..

1260
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:49,760
Madhu.

1261
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,440
Madhu, where are you going?

1262
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,280
I am going back. He told
his friend that I am a..

1263
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:03,280
That is am pregnant
and I can't dance.

1264
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,760
Madhu, Raj and I are your
friends and well wishers.

1265
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,720
We will never say anything
which will hurt you.

1266
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,080
You want to dance. Come.

1267
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,200
No, I don't want to dance.

1268
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:33,000
Raj, human minds if someone whom..

1269
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,440
..he regards to be close
says anything.

1270
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:40,320
Priya, I have not told you
a thing about Madhu.

1271
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,200
I know. I have heard everything.

1272
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,480
You were right in not
telling me this before.

1273
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,440
Maybe I wouldn't have accepted..

1274
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,160
..Madhu then after knowing this.

1275
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:03,160
But today I can say that Madhu
is best to mother our child.

1276
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,320
Isn't it?
- Yes.

1277
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:25,520
How is Madhu?
- I have just come from her room.

1278
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,320
She is still angry.

1279
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,280
She will feel very
bad if we 2 leave..

1280
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,680
..her alone for the
shaving ceremony.

1281
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:36,600
Then let's cancel the visit.
- No. Vicky brother will mind.

1282
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,360
Let's do one thing. I will go
to the ceremony. You stay here.

1283
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,760
And I will make the excuse that
you couldn't come due to work.

1284
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,920
Yes, okay.
Go and pack your luggage.

1285
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,600
I will drop you at
the station. Come.

1286
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,120
Drink the juice.

1287
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,320
Smoking is very good for your
and the baby's health.

1288
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,560
Look, Madhu. I know you are upset.

1289
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:26,320
But when you came to the
Munabi conference..

1290
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,840
..in that dress and behaviour..

1291
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,760
Ajay was there too.

1292
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,560
Why will I tell this to Ajay when
I concealed it from my wife?

1293
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:47,720
If you still think that I
am guilty then I am sorry.

1294
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:54,880
Smoke.

1295
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:47,040
Hi. Were you bathing?
- Raj is not at home.

1296
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,840
He is at the office.
- Yes, I know he is at the office.

1297
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:52,760
And is going to come late. And
even Priya is not at home.

1298
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,000
She has gone to
her cousin's place.

1299
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:55,560
That's why I have come.

1300
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:02,840
I couldn't control since the time
I have seen you at the party.

1301
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,400
That's why I came as soon
as I got the chance.

1302
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,480
I have enjoyed every sort
girl in the world.

1303
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:13,960
But no one has the thing you have.

1304
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,640
Please go away from here.

1305
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:18,480
Yes, I understood.

1306
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,600
You are worried because you
are in Raj's contract.

1307
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,760
We don't have any problem.

1308
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,680
He is my business partner and
my childhood friend too.

1309
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,200
He won't have any objection.
Let's not waste time now.

1310
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,600
You lowly whore you slapped me.

1311
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,880
Come on get up. Here.

1312
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,840
You try to act decent.

1313
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:09,720
I will take out your decency now.

1314
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,440
Raj, I thought..

1315
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:56,680
What did you think? That
you will rape her.

1316
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:59,040
That you will rape her.
-What are you doing, Raj?

1317
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,240
That you will rape her.
- Listen to me, Raj.

1318
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,440
That you will rape her.

1319
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:06,160
Raj! Raja. Raj, listen to me.

1320
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,360
Raj, my..

1321
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,360
Raj, what are you doing?

1322
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,680
You are beating me for
this lowly prostitute.

1323
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,920
You saw a prostitute in her.
I didn't see one.

1324
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:29,040
How did you see? How did you see?

1325
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,160
How did you see?
- Raj!

1326
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:36,160
Raj, you are beating your
childhood friend for such a girl.

1327
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:43,720
Childhood friend.
Childhood friend.

1328
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:50,200
If you were even my brother, even
then I would have killed you.

1329
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:51,360
Understand?

1330
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:58,160
Raj, you are kicking your 500
crore partnership for her.

1331
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:04,720
I will throw away the
entire wealth for her.

1332
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:06,520
Understand?

1333
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:11,840
Do you know why? Because
she is precious for me.

1334
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:17,080
You are friend, right. That's
why leave from here.

1335
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,880
Otherwise I will kill you.
Understand? Go.

1336
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:36,840
Come. Come.

1337
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,880
Come. Come.

1338
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,040
I will go get the medicines.

1339
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:28,160
Call me if you
need anything, okay.

1340
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,200
Hi!

1341
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:19,360
This is for you.

1342
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:09,000
Raj.

1343
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:03,480
Madhu.
- Yes.

1344
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,080
Take this.

1345
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:19,280
What were you thinking?

1346
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:22,840
I was remembering my childhood.

1347
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:31,680
My mother used to tell me
takes when I was young.

1348
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,080
There was poor girl.

1349
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:38,280
One day a prince came to
her riding a white horse.

1350
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,600
And took her away as his bride.

1351
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:45,280
And then her dreams
were fulfilled.

1352
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:49,760
Even I used to see this
dream all the time.

1353
02:02:54,280 --> 02:03:00,760
When I grew up, many white
cars came to me.

1354
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:03,880
There were many princes
among them too.

1355
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:12,320
But no one came to take
me. All came buy me.

1356
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:20,880
Then I realised that that was
just a childhood fairy tale.

1357
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,080
This doesn't happen in reality.

1358
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,840
Thank you very much.

1359
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:37,280
Raj and Priya will be
amazed to see us.

1360
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,280
Chhotu,
unload the luggage quickly.

1361
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:42,400
Bansi, how will carry
so much luggage alone?

1362
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:43,520
Come with me.

1363
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:51,400
Priya, grandpa has come with
the entire family. - What?

1364
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,240
That is your family.
- Yes.

1365
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:56,840
Priya, there will be trouble.
They think you are pregnant.

1366
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:58,760
O God!
- One second.

1367
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:04,440
No, this will be too big.
- This. - Yes, this is okay.

1368
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,960
And listen you wear this amulet.

1369
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,080
But the veneration
flowers are here.

1370
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:09,360
Yes, I know it contains
veneration flowers.

1371
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:11,240
You keep the veneration
flowers and you wear it.

1372
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:12,320
Raj.

1373
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,200
Daughter-in-law. We have arrived.

1374
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:17,240
You will be very happy.
- Where are you?

1375
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:24,400
Grandpa.
- Dear Raj. - Mother. Grandpa.

1376
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:27,600
Live long. Live long.
- Dad. - How are you, son?

1377
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:29,200
Good to see you. Good to see you.
- Mother.

1378
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:31,640
Did we surprise you?
- Absolutely. - Live long, son.

1379
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,800
This is not fair.
- Why? - You came without informing.

1380
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:40,720
Surprise. - We cannot stay
without seeing Priya.

1381
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:42,320
So we have come.
- But where is Priya.

1382
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:45,600
Where is she? - She is tying the
pillow. - Tying the pillow?

1383
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:48,720
Tying the pillow? What did you
hear? - What did you say?

1384
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:49,840
She is changing.

1385
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:55,440
Priya.

1386
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:58,160
Come dear, come.

1387
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,160
My child. Greetings, mamma.

1388
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:02,640
Live long. You have given
me all happiness.

1389
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:07,400
No, dear, don't bend. Live long.
- Greetings, father.

1390
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,280
How are you?
- Live long.

1391
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:10,400
Wait I will cast of your evil eye.
- Grandpa.

1392
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:12,520
How are you, dear? - I am fine.

1393
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:15,480
How are you Pappu brother?

1394
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,240
How are you uncle?
- How are you Priya dear?

1395
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:23,080
I told you if God wants you will
have a child within a year.

1396
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:28,200
What mamma? You shouldn't have
surprised us like this?

1397
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,720
You should have told us.

1398
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:32,400
We would have come to fetch
you at the airport.

1399
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:36,640
We wanted to but then father said
we shouldn't bother daughter-in-law.

1400
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,480
There is nothing to bother here.

1401
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,920
We have come to give a surprise.

1402
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,160
What happened?
- What happened?

1403
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,000
This is my friend's wife, Madhu.

1404
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:02,760
Her husband generally stays
out because of business.

1405
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,600
There is no one in her house
that's why she stays with us

1406
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:06,760
All right.

1407
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:08,840
That is good dear.

1408
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:11,240
You shouldn't stay alone
at such times.

1409
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:14,000
Come here. Come here.

1410
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:17,560
Greetings.
- Stay happy. Live long.

1411
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:20,280
I am Priya's mother-in-law.
- I know.

1412
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:22,680
Priya tells me about you everyday.

1413
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:27,640
You are aunt. You are uncle.
And you are Pappu brother.

1414
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:30,160
And you are grandpa. Greetings.

1415
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:32,280
Don't bend down. Live long,
dear. Live long.

1416
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,200
And you are father. Greetings.

1417
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,280
Grandpa. Won't you cast
away my evil eye?

1418
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:45,560
Why not, dear? Live
long. Stay happy.

1419
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:46,760
Always stay wedded.

1420
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,560
It is not a laughing matter.

1421
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:55,280
Why does Mithun Chakraborty
stay in Ooty?

1422
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:58,320
So that he seems fairer
among the people there.

1423
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:02,160
Grandpa biscuits.
- Thank you.

1424
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:06,960
Madhu dear, what business
does your husband do?

1425
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:11,720
Of import and export.
- Yes, grandpa.

1426
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:14,320
That's why he is often in U.K.
Austria, Indonesia, Malaysia..

1427
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:15,280
He always stays outside.

1428
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:16,600
All right.

1429
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:18,680
No matter what.
Business will go on.

1430
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,400
But the husband should be with
his wife at such times.

1431
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,840
No problem, daughter-in-law.

1432
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:27,680
We will look after her the same
way we will look after Priya.

1433
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:53,760
After hearing this Lord Vishnu
started crying as a child.

1434
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:56,720
And seeing his cute from
mother Kaushalya..

1435
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,760
..started shedding tears
of joy and affection.

1436
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:04,760
It is said that if a pregnant
lady hears the description of..

1437
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:08,960
..Lord Ram's birth then even
her unborn child enjoys it.

1438
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:10,840
Feel and see.

1439
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:14,040
Some movement must
be taking place.

1440
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:30,480
Madhu dear. Why are
you standing there?

1441
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:31,800
Come and sit here.

1442
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,520
Come.

1443
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:38,480
Sit. So listen.

1444
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:43,520
How was father Dasrath during
Lord Ram's birth?

1445
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:46,840
Because a father rejoices twice..

1446
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:50,280
..over his baby's birth
than the mother.

1447
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:55,640
What are you thinking, dear?

1448
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:59,640
That your husband is not with you.

1449
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:03,600
He might have some problem.

1450
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:08,280
But he must be always thinking
about you and your baby.

1451
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:11,600
So Tulsi Das said that Ram..

1452
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:23,400
Priya. Dear Priya.
- Yes, mother.

1453
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:26,920
These are special sweets.
Remember?

1454
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:28,600
I have brought them
from Delhi for you.

1455
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,120
Take eat it. Well done.

1456
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,600
Come Madhu sister.

1457
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:45,440
Mother has brought special
sweets for me from Delhi.

1458
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:47,960
It will benefit you
if you eat it. Eat.

1459
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:55,280
It is spicy right.

1460
02:09:55,680 --> 02:09:58,840
I used to find it spicy too when
I was expecting last year.

1461
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,480
That's' why mother used to
force me into eating it.

1462
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:04,040
Will you eat another?
- Madhu.

1463
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:06,840
Mother is coming. Don't tell
her that you ate the sweet.

1464
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:11,960
Madhu.
- Yes, mother. - You are here.

1465
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:13,680
And I was looking for
you in your room.

1466
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:15,440
I was sitting with Grandpa.

1467
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:19,000
What is the matter?
You are crying.

1468
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:23,560
No, I was watching a sentimental
movie that's why..

1469
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:25,920
You cried. Come with me.

1470
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:29,920
Come sit. Slowly.

1471
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:33,480
Madhu dear these
are special sweets.

1472
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,960
Both mother and baby benefit
by eating these.

1473
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:40,040
Come on eat it.
- No, mother. I will eat them later.

1474
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,720
No, not later. You will have
to eat them in front of me.

1475
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:46,000
Otherwise you won't eat it.
I know it is a little spicy.

1476
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,840
Come on open your mouth.
- No mother. Mother I..

1477
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:50,920
Well done. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth. Well done.

1478
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:54,600
Well done. It's okay,
right? Well done.

1479
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:01,320
Madhu, your feet have swelled up.

1480
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:06,200
I told him but
he said this happens.

1481
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:09,480
It surely happens but too
much welling is not good.

1482
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:12,560
I will apply the medicinal
oil in your feet.

1483
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:13,840
Swelling will stop by that.

1484
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:17,040
Bansi, bring that medicinal oil.

1485
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:22,520
Place it here.
- Yes. - Come dear. - No, mother.

1486
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:27,600
I won't like you to touch my feet.
- But I will like it.

1487
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:31,120
The one whom I have called
daughter is a daughter to me.

1488
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:32,640
You are my daughter, right?

1489
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:48,080
Who are there in your
family, daughter?

1490
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:51,120
I don't have anyone, mother.

1491
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:54,400
There must be someone in India.

1492
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:58,760
They are not in this world.

1493
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:10,480
In future never say
that you have no one.

1494
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:14,600
From now this entire
family is yours.

1495
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:38,320
Hello. Greetings priest. How
are you? Yes, one minute.

1496
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,240
Grandpa. - Yes, dear. - Priest
has called from Delhi.

1497
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:47,280
Hello. Yes priest. Greetings.
- Whose call is it? - Priest's.

1498
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:49,440
What is he saying?
- I don't know. - All right.

1499
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:53,800
We will do as you say. You
start the preparations.

1500
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,080
What preparations grandpa?

1501
02:12:56,120 --> 02:13:01,080
Raj, priest has fixed the 18th
for Priya's baby shower.

1502
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:03,920
Congratulations. We will go
to Delhi tomorrow. All right.

1503
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:06,720
Ranjeet. Daughter-in-law.

1504
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:10,440
Raj, how can we return to India?

1505
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:12,360
Madhu should be with us too.

1506
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:16,200
Because Priya's baby shower
has been fixed for the 18th.

1507
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:17,840
Come.

1508
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:22,080
Go to the office with Raj and call a
board meeting to explain everybody.

1509
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:25,960
Yes, father. - Grandpa, can't
you call the priest here.

1510
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,280
And have the baby shower here.
- Why?

1511
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:30,560
Because Priya's delivery
date is due this month.

1512
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:33,120
And the medical facilities
are good here.

1513
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:34,960
Don't talk about facilities.

1514
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,920
I will make a call and transfer
all facilities to Delhi.

1515
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:40,040
What is the phone number of
the facility minister here?

1516
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,800
There is no facility of
ministers here. - Is it?

1517
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:45,080
Bihar is better than this place.

1518
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:48,240
Son Raj we will find all medical
facilities in Delhi.

1519
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:52,440
And baby shower is done where
you have friends and relatives.

1520
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:55,280
You are right, mother. We
all will go to India.

1521
02:13:56,240 --> 02:14:01,200
Madhu, I had promised your husband
that I will look after you.

1522
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:04,680
Because your and Priya's delivery
date is on the same day.

1523
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,880
But all of us are going to
India for the baby shower.

1524
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:08,880
And I can never refuse grandpa.

1525
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:12,400
But I will do all your
hospital bookings.

1526
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:14,760
And go whenever you have
the labour pains.

1527
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:18,040
Manage that, please.
- Have you gone crazy?

1528
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:20,880
How can she go alone to the
hospital at such conditions?

1529
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:23,160
Grandpa she has no other way out.

1530
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:24,760
Who is there with her?

1531
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:27,720
And she cannot even come to
India with us. - Why not?

1532
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:30,080
You had promised
her husband, right?

1533
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:34,160
Yes, I had. - All of you listen.
This is my decision.

1534
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:36,600
That Madhu will come
with us to Delhi.

1535
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:40,200
Why dear? Do you have
any objections? - No.

1536
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:46,920
Hi.

1537
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,360
Come, brother.
- Greetings.

1538
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:50,520
That is my papa and those are
my brother and sister-in-law.

1539
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:53,080
What have they brought?
- Gifts.

1540
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:55,120
The pregnant mother wears
clothes gifted..

1541
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:56,560
..by her family during
the baby shower.

1542
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:58,920
This is very big occasion.

1543
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:03,120
Greetings.
- Come. Come. - Come. Come. -Come.

1544
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:04,680
Pappu, listen.
- Yes.

1545
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:06,600
The priest is asking for
rice. Arrange for it.

1546
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:07,440
Shall I call the food minister?

1547
02:15:07,480 --> 02:15:08,720
How many sacks do you want?

1548
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,760
You will call the minister
for a fistful of rice.

1549
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,360
Bring from the kitchen.
- A fistful. - Okay. - Come.

1550
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:15,120
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1551
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:17,920
Have you see Bhatia uncle,
anywhere?

1552
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:20,760
I didn't see him. But
what is the matter?

1553
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,160
Are you copying me?

1554
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:25,880
No, this is my childhood habit.

1555
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:30,200
Did you mother go to the
red bungalow in Fatehpur.

1556
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:34,440
My mother has never gone to
the red bungalow in Fatehpur.

1557
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,280
My father used to go their often.

1558
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:47,800
Father always used to say that
you have a sister. Father.

1559
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:54,160
Priya your gift dress has arrived.

1560
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:57,880
Now get ready quickly.
- Mother, go downstairs.

1561
02:15:57,920 --> 02:15:59,280
I will prepare
Priya and bring her.

1562
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:04,320
No, dear. You cannot
come downstairs.

1563
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:08,200
Look dear even I wanted to have
your baby shower with Priya.

1564
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,760
But the priest said that
2 pregnant ladies..

1565
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,880
..cannot attend this
function together.

1566
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:14,800
All right, mother.

1567
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:21,880
And dear Priya. Decorate yourself
like a bride today.

1568
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:26,960
Yes. - Baby shower is a big
occasion in a woman's life.

1569
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:30,800
Because a woman has
not 1 but 3 births.

1570
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:34,520
First when she comes to this
world as someone's daughter.

1571
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,920
2nd when she becomes
someone's wife.

1572
02:16:39,559 --> 02:16:41,519
And 3rd when she becomes a mother.

1573
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:48,440
And baby shower is being done
before becoming a mother..

1574
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:54,200
..so that the baby to be born
is blessed with happiness.

1575
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:01,320
Now get ready quickly. It is
time for the shower, dear.

1576
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:07,320
Raj, you here. Don't engage
Priya in talks now.

1577
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:09,400
She has to get ready and come
downstairs, okay. - Yes.

1578
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,600
Raj, I cannot go to this function.
- Why?

1579
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:14,880
Mother said it is
no ordinary custom.

1580
02:17:15,320 --> 02:17:18,720
This veneration and prayers are
being made to bless our child.

1581
02:17:19,639 --> 02:17:22,399
Madhu should attend this
shower instead of me.

1582
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:24,720
But how is that possible?

1583
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:28,280
If Madhu wears my wedding dress
then there will be a veil.

1584
02:17:28,719 --> 02:17:31,279
And nobody will know
that she is Madhu.

1585
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:37,760
Please Raj.

1586
02:17:46,959 --> 02:17:50,119
Madhu, will you wear
this gift dress?

1587
02:17:51,879 --> 02:17:52,959
All right.

1588
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:55,000
Thank you.

1589
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:14,360
Sister-in-law- Yes. - go and
see if Priya is ready.

1590
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:16,440
Go and bring her. Hurry up.
- Okay. - Aunt.

1591
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:17,800
I will go and see. Mother,
I will bring her.

1592
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:19,760
Look. All right, you
go and bring her.

1593
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:29,040
Who is it?
- Me.

1594
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:39,280
Is Madhu ready?
- Yes, she is. - Oh my god. Girls.

1595
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:42,240
Hey, I forgot the sacred thread..
- Listen.

1596
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:45,280
I will make her wear it. You go.
- Okay, I will go that side.

1597
02:19:19,799 --> 02:19:22,199
Priya. Priya. Come here.

1598
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:51,160
The one who will give my family
my heir, I salute you.

1599
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:53,920
May God let our
child live for eras.

1600
02:19:54,840 --> 02:20:00,560
And your child should spread
my family's name like sun.

1601
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:11,960
Let God add my age to your child.

1602
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:18,200
He should bring incomparable
happiness to your life.

1603
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:27,440
Priya, you have got such a dark
henna colour in your hands.

1604
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:31,800
This means Raj loves you a lot.

1605
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:30,440
We have to take a family
photograph. Come.

1606
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:31,960
Come. Come. Come.
- Yes.

1607
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,120
Come. Come.
- Come Raj dear.

1608
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:38,160
Yes, take a photograph.

1609
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:13,320
"Henna."
- Priest, start the veneration.

1610
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:22,760
Tell the baby's grandfather.

1611
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,840
Lala Kailash Nath Malhotra.

1612
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:27,440
Lala Kailash Nath Malhotra's
great grandson is arriving.

1613
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:30,080
The entire clan should benefit.

1614
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:31,760
The Baby's grandfather's name.

1615
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:34,120
Ranjeet Kumar Malhotra.

1616
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:38,520
Ranjeet Kumar Malhotra grandson
should get all success.

1617
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:41,640
The baby grandma's name.
- Asha Malhotra.

1618
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:45,200
Asha Malhotra's grandson
should live long.

1619
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:46,960
The baby's father's name.

1620
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:49,480
Raj Malhotra.

1621
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:53,200
Raj Malhotra should live long.

1622
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:54,880
The baby's mother's name.

1623
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:08,520
Priya Malhotra.

1624
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:44,760
Mother.

1625
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,400
The function was great today.
- Very nice.

1626
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:49,600
The best was father's dance.
What do you have to say?

1627
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:53,280
What a storm? I will have
the windows closes.

1628
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:56,080
It is late now. You go and
sleep too. - Okay, mother.

1629
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:58,440
Sleep tight. Live long.

1630
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:02,000
Bansi!

1631
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:10,480
Madhu.

1632
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:16,200
Madhu.

1633
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,320
Madhu.

1634
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,440
Have you seen Madhu anywhere?

1635
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:48,720
Yes, she has just left towards
the station. - What?

1636
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:09,320
Madhu.

1637
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:11,160
Where are you going?

1638
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:15,320
Priya Malhotra is not the mother
of this baby. It is me.

1639
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:19,800
This is my baby. I
won't give my baby.

1640
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:24,280
Forgive me.
I can't give this baby.

1641
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:26,840
Madhu, don't say like this.

1642
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:29,280
I have done penance for 9 months
for the baby's birth.

1643
02:28:29,320 --> 02:28:31,480
We have dreamt for this
baby every day.

1644
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:32,800
This time not only
me and Raj, but..

1645
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:36,320
..our entire family is waiting
for this baby's birth.

1646
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:39,120
Our happiness is connected
to it, Madhu.

1647
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:42,080
I will die,
but won't give my baby.

1648
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:45,040
Madhu, you don't have anything
lacking like me.

1649
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:47,720
You can get married. You
can be a mother again.

1650
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,400
But I am not complete. I
can never be a mother.

1651
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:56,240
Madhu, I pray give me this baby.

1652
02:28:57,640 --> 02:29:02,080
I will give you whatever you
want for it. Money, property.

1653
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:04,360
Madhu, tell me what do you need?

1654
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:07,640
All right, I am ready
to give you my baby.

1655
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:10,000
Can you give me your husband?

1656
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:22,360
At last you have shown
me your reality.

1657
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:26,200
I though even
prostitutes are woman.

1658
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:31,640
But a prostitute can
do no good to others.

1659
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:34,000
She can only break homes.

1660
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:39,080
I asked you your husband and
you reminded me my reality.

1661
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:41,400
You are asking a mother her child.

1662
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:46,360
A mother is mother whether she is
a prostitute or a daughter-in-law.

1663
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:49,480
I won't give you my baby.

1664
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:53,320
I won't give you my baby. My baby.

1665
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:58,000
Raj. Raj. She is refusing
to give our baby.

1666
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:01,640
Priya, first look at
her condition. Madhu. Madhu.

1667
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:05,840
Madhu. Madhu. Madhu. Call
doctor grandpa immediately.

1668
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:17,080
Don't worry. Everything
will be fine.

1669
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:38,360
We are scanning Madhu.

1670
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:41,200
We will get to know the
complications soon.

1671
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:47,200
Mother is calling. Yes, mother.

1672
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:50,160
You, Priya and Madhu are not
at home. Where are you?

1673
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:51,560
Mother we are at the hospital.

1674
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:53,240
Madhu and Priya's labour
pain has started.

1675
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:54,480
So I brought them here.

1676
02:30:54,520 --> 02:30:57,200
What? I will give this
good news to everyone.

1677
02:30:57,240 --> 02:30:59,280
We are reaching the hospital. Okay.
- No, mother. No.

1678
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:03,720
You can come later. Okay.
Doctor grandpa is with me.

1679
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,960
I am just coming.

1680
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,200
Excuse me.

1681
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:08,600
The doctor has called you inside.

1682
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:10,600
Come.

1683
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:18,000
The baby has turned that's why it
is not in its normal position.

1684
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:19,760
We have to operate
her immediately.

1685
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:21,920
All right, go ahead.
- But the condition is serious.

1686
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:25,600
I can save either the mother
or baby in this operation.

1687
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:29,600
We have to decide quickly.

1688
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:38,240
Doctor, save the mother.

1689
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:45,680
Prepare her to be taken to the
operation theatre. - Yes.

1690
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,720
Nurse, take Mr. Raj's signature.
- All right.

1691
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:00,480
Come on, nurse. Take
her inside. Careful.

1692
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:33,000
Good news. This happens
in rare cases.

1693
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:34,600
The operation was successful.

1694
02:32:35,320 --> 02:32:37,120
Both the baby and Madhu are safe.

1695
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:48,880
Congratulations, you had a son.

1696
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:18,320
What ac cute baby.

1697
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:23,600
You wanted to save
the mother, right?

1698
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:28,360
The mother is saved
and even your baby.

1699
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:36,520
I was moved a bit for a while.
I became selfish.

1700
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:40,480
You are the mother of this baby.

1701
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:45,200
He is yours.

1702
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,520
Give me my great grandson.

1703
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:10,720
Look. Look.
- SO sweet. So sweet.

1704
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:14,120
I am your great grandpa.
- Give him to me, please.

1705
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:19,720
Yes, what did our Madhu
have? Boy or girl?

1706
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:24,920
That poor girl lost
her child at birth..

1707
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:34,600
No dear,
don't dishearten yourself.

1708
02:34:35,360 --> 02:34:36,760
Think that it was not yours.

1709
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:39,720
The same had happened
to our Priya too.

1710
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:44,240
But see, God had made
her a mother in a year.

1711
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:46,320
Yes, dear.

1712
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:13,480
Don't go, Madhu. I will tell
the family members the truth.

1713
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:21,240
If 2 brothers can stay together
then why not 2 sisters?

1714
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:28,000
I have got an entire family here.
I only lacked a sister.

1715
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:30,680
I have found her too, today.

1716
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:36,880
Let this sister remain a sister.
Don't make her your co-wife.

1717
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:42,760
Otherwise no woman will
trust another woman.

1718
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:50,000
Only you have the right
on this family and Raj.

1719
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:55,800
My rights are on the
memories I got here.

1720
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:03,880
I became a daughter here,
a bride and a mother.

1721
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:06,600
What else do I want?

1722
02:36:19,320 --> 02:36:21,720
Madhu, I have checked you on.

1723
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:23,480
This is your boarding pass.

1724
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:25,680
I have deposited your
bags in the luggage.

1725
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:28,760
This contains the keys
to your new house.

1726
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:32,920
And some blank cheques
with your name.

1727
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:42,320
My entire wealth is less for what
you did for me and Priya.

1728
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:50,080
Just consider this to be a small
gift from me and Priya.

1729
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:53,360
I have taken the gift. See this.

1730
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,120
I am taking me entire
family with me.

1731
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:01,720
If I take anything more than
that then I will feel..

1732
02:37:02,440 --> 02:37:04,800
..that a mother has taken
the price of her baby.

1733
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:06,440
But Madhu you..

1734
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:10,800
I won't return to that world
from where you brought me.

1735
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:16,200
You have touched me once.

1736
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:18,720
Now no one else can touch me.

1737
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:37,320
Thank you.
