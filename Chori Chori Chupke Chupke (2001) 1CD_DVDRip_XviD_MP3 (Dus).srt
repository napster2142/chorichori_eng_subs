Mr.Malhotra,generally there is
discord in joint family's

26
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,190
What is the secret of harmony
in your family?

27
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,460
It's very simple

28
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,660
My son looks after
the business

29
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,200
His brother-in-law
helps him in it

I mean,I get every household
work by 1 phone call

34
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,500
I've access to the
top people

35
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,240
Every Central Minister & Secretary
are very close to me -

36
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,140
I'm not bragging

37
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,680
He doesn't call a mechanic to
repair the T.V in the house

38
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,350
He phones directly to the Minister
of Information & Broadcasting

39
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,620
He is Pappu

40
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,090
Son of our Old Manager

41
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,360
He has been brought up here only
since his childhood

42
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,430
He is like my son

43
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,020
If you have any work with the
Minister tell me -

44
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,090
I'll get it done
in a jiffy

45
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,870
Don't misunderstand him,This
is his habit.

46
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,900
He is right.

47
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,910
Is any Tv serial's shooting
going on !

48
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,640
Only the Villian was missing,
sit down,sit down!

49
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
He is Dr. Balaraj

50
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,240
He's my childhood friend
But he's no less than my enemy!

51
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,770
He has put restrictions on
clarified butter,sugar & salt.

52
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,880
And has left pappu here
as his spy!

53
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,920
If I hadn't restricted,you'll be dead
as of now,you've so many diseases!

54
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,890
What are you talking

55
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,280
Alright alright I am looking
alright,isn't it?

56
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,250
Alright Mr. Malhotra,
one last question.

57
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,120
Your family is so happy,your life
is so successful

58
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,130
Do you have any other desire
which you want to fulfil.

59
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,600
I am waiting for a
companion.

60
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,940
Are you contemplating marriage
at this age!

61
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,200
Marriage?!?!

62
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,260
Oh no! I'm waiting for my
great grandchild.

63
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,260
Who will be my toy!

64
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,140
Who'll become my support
instead of this stick!

65
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,670
And He'll keep my name alive
even after my death!

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,480
And when'll this waiting
come to an end!

67
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,110
When my grandson Raj agrees to
get married

68
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,650
At the moment he has gone to
attend his friend's marriage.

69
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,330
Please leave me,-no no...

70
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,960

You danced very well in
the function.

75
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,760
You were saying something?

76
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,360
Yes. Your child is very sweet.
Just like you.

77
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,190
All say like this only
No son.

78
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,300
Sister-in-law,take your son.

79
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,700
What was he saying?

80
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,870
He! He was saying that
''your son is very sweet''.-

81
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,210
Just like you.

82
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,710
He thought he
was my child.

83
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,530
Ay chotu,water is not coming
in this pipe.

84
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,210
What are you talking?

85
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,540
What's heppening?

86
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,540
Not working,you're gossiping?

87
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,540
We're not gosping
Pappu brother.

88
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,710
Water is not coming in this,
some blockage is there.

89
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,890
Go & mow the lawn.

90
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,380
Water is not coming?

91
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:12,880
I am an orphan,if there's anyone
in this world,its you!

92
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,050
Whom are you phoning?

93
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,550
I'm phoning the irrigation
minister-why?

94
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,550
Water is not coming in
the pipe.

95
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,390
Phone the plumber.

96
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,560
Why call the plumber
for such minor jobs?

97
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,890
What's the irrigation minister for?
-For irritation.

98
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,400
Only he appriciates me in the
entire family,water.

99
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,900
Did you,I just dialled & the

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,930
Good you've come.Go to singapore
immediately-

112
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,430
And find out out why our ship hasn't
started from there

113
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,270
Our dealer's are bothering
us a lot here.

114
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,420
What type of a
father you are?

115
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,760
Son has just returned & you're
sending him out again.

116
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,430
You always want to send him out
of the country.

117
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,760
Dad,somebody has to go.

118
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,440
Then send some one else.

119
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,100
Pankaj you go.

120
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,930
But who'll attend to the
work here?

121
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,270
Did you bring it?-yes

122
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,110
Suppose our theft
is detected.

123
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,110
One who is caught
is a thief.

124
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,930
Conspirary between grandfather
& grandson!

125
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,100
There is something fishy.

126
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,610
Now take it out

127
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,770
Grandpa,only one-yes only one.

128
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,780
Oh! lovely sweet.

129
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,120
They are sweet like your
affection & soft like my heart,.

130
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,120
Don't be poetic. Eat quickly
It's a risky matter.

131
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,120
You may lock the door but I've
the master key.

132
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,620
What's happening?

133
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,120
Eating sweet steathlty.

134
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,620
You have advanced
diabeties-That too 320.

135
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,720
Uncle,it's a sin for you to even
touch sweets.

136
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,460
You're taking medicine
and sweet also.

137
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,300
And I'm scolded that I've eaten
all the sweets.

138
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,660
Dad,if you're not thinking about
you.Atleast think about us.

139
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,800
Enough. All of you have ganged
against a sick old man.

140
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,470
At least ask me why
I got the sweet?

141
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,530
One wrong girl'll come &
nullify everything.

142
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,640
Why did you get the
sweets?- why?

143
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,960
Because Raj has said yes.

144
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,140
He has said yes.

145
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,640
For what?

146
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,970
For the marriage.

147
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,310
What're you doing? He is tired
let him take rest.

148
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,980
I'll talk to him & tell you
everything later.

149
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
Take the sweets and all
of you eat it,go....

150
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,980
What sort of a Grandpa
you are?

151
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,650
Why?

152
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,150
To save yourself you've
put me in a soup.

153
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,820
And what sort of a
grandson you are?

154
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,820
To save the prestige
of their grandpa-

155
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,320
Grandsons sacrifice their
lives also.

156
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,150
And you are not agreeing
to get married also.

157
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,490
Listen sorry,If you don't
get married.

158
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,660
How'll the malhotra
dynesty subsist.

159
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,670
Grandpa this family
is like this

160
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,500
Everyone loves each other
immensly.

161
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,830
Do you think I'll bring
such a girl?

162
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,500
Still,I won't get
married.

163
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,180
Are you telling sorry?

164
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,510
I am your grandfather. I'll see
how you don't get married.

165
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,010
And I am also your grandosn
Give it.

166
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,910
Open your mouth.

167
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,340
It doesn't mean that I've agreed
to get married.

168
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,680
And this sweet is also
sugar free.Eat it.

169
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,360
How nice you look!

170
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,020
Miss Baructha,how many times
have I told you..

171
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,700
Yes. Had I married,I'd have 2
small children also.

172
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,020
But I'm not married yet.

173
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,360
I'm also not married.

174
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,030
And understand this.

175
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,200
Until I get a nice handsome boy
like you,I won't get married.

176
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,870
And don't get married
miss Barucha.

177
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,930
What are you seeing.

178
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,370
Son Raj,I am doctor
Balraj speaking.

179
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,400
Yes doctor uncle.

180
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,200
Son you come to my
nursing home immidiately.

181
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,210
Your Grandpa is slightly
unwell.

182
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,420
Not slightly but
very unwell.

183
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,050
Yes Yes,he is very ill.

184
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,890
But he was alright in
the morning.

185
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,050
In this age one can get unwell
at any time.

186
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,050
Okay I'm coming.

187
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,050
He is coming.

188
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,730
Mother was there any
phone from doctor uncle!

189
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,230
He was here only.

190
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,230
He did the routine
check up of Grandpa!

191
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,430
And Then both of them
went for a walk.

192
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,570
But why are you asking?

193
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,080
Nothing mother. Okay, Bye.

194
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,400
Act in such a way that
it should look real.

195
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,070
You don't worry Kailash

196
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,240
You know that I used to come
1st in college in acting.

197
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,440
Grandpa,Raj has come,
lie down,lie down.

198
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,080
After giving you 2
Injections also!

199
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,910
Your pulse is not becoming
normal

200
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,110
What is your worry after all?

201
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,910
You still have 1 years life.

202
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,080
In 1 year all the wishes of a man
can be fulfilled.

203
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,120
What's that? You tell me I'll
fulfill his wish.

204
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,920
I've only one wish.

205
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,260
To see the face of my great grand
son before,I die.

206
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,920
But Raj doesn't love his grandpa
but he loves his freedom.

207
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,590
Open your eyes kailash
Raj has come

208
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,100
where are you,Raj?

209
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,770
I am here,Grandpa

210
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,600
With a suit on,You're lying on
the hospital bed.

211
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,940
I had to lie in emergency-

212
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,110
And You had to act
also in emergemcy

213
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,110
Doctor uncle you also joined hands.

214
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,770
What could I do? Your grandpa made
me to do all this.

215
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,780
Grandpa,why are you doing
all these things?

216
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,950
You know how valuable you
are to me!

217
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,620
I'm valuable,isn't it?

218
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,820
Then fulfil my wish.

219
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,630
Tell me when'll you come to see
the girl? come on tell me!

220
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,450
Whenever you say.

221
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,460
Priya,it seems they've come.

222
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,800
Come come Mr. Malhotra.

223
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,970
Greetings Mr. Kapoor.

224
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,640
Mr. Kapoor,he's my
grandson Raj.

225
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,160
May you live long.

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,030
He is the same person who I had
met in Suman's marriage.

227
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,640
I understood the situation,when
I saw you both there.

228
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,140
That's why we've asked
for this alliance.

229
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,980
I've already liked
your daughter.

230
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,150
We wanted Raj to see
her today.

231
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,330
Come daughter,come.

232
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:01,990
Greetings

233
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,830
God bless you,sit down!

234
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,330
How do you like her!

235
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,000
Grandpa,don't you find
her age a little more.

236
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,670
What are you talking
I've
seen her horoscope.

237
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,340
Her age is perfect.

238
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,750
It seems grandpa has seen the
horoscpe without glasses.

239
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,510
Her cheeks are so fat

240
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,010
That is the symbol
of rich people.

241
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,210
See her beautiful smile
How beautiful!!

242
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,680
The girl next to her
looks better.

243
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,360
She is the mother
of a child.

244
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,690
This girl looks like the
mother of 4 children.

245
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,620
What are you talking? She doesn't
look like that at all.

246
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,520
Son if you wish to ask
her anyting then go ahead.

247
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,530
Yes,Yes,if you want
you ask her.

248
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,040
Me! I have studied upto
7th standard-

249
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,710
But she is a double
graduate.

250
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,050
She is an expert in
domestic chores-

251
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,210
All these savories & sweets are
prepared by her.

252
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,870
That means she doesn't
know anything.

253
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,710
She knows all these
what else do you want!

254
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,220
Why is he asking these
questions to me?

255
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,720
He is still looking at you

256
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,210
Be ready. He'll ask
one more question..

257
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,050
What are your hobbies?

258
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,890
These are all her hobbies.

259
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,050
she always praises others.

260
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,720
She herself is a gold medalist
in ''KABBADI''

261
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,400
IN KABBADI!

262
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,660
Now child I also want
to ask you something.

263
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,400
Tell me what's most important to
keep the family happy?

264
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,070
It is love

265
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,400
Let the number of members
be more or less

266
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,400
But if eveyone loves each other
then the household becomes heaven.

267
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,080
Very good. What noble
thoughts!

268
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,070
Why bother about her
noble thoughts?

269
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,740
Ask her noble thought

270
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,080
Why do you want to know the noble
thoughts of her sister-in-law?

271
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,240
Sister-in-law?'' - Yes

272
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,080
Don't cry child. Madam your
son was crying?

273
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,420
Come,Come,my son.

274
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,420
Congratulations Mr. Kapoor
Raj has liked the girl.

275
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,430
From our side the alliance
is confirmed.

276
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,090
Now you fix the marriage date
-Sure,have sweets

277
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,000
Doctor Uncle,There's no differnce
between love & photograph

278
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,680
How's it?

279
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,850
Both are developed in Darkness!

280
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:02,850
Shameless fellow!

281
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,010
Hey! look at Raj's photograph!
Who had taken it?

282
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,350
Look....Look at this!

283
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,010
Mother,I had taken this photo!

284
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,670
Raj was unaware,when I took
this photograph!

285
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,850
I feel you both have liked
Switzerland very much!

286
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:19,020
If that's true,why don't you & Raj
settle there for few years!

287
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,190
Absolutely no,they both are
not going anywhere!

288
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,690
Till now,I was worrying for son
after sending him abroad!

289
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,520
Now,even Daughter-in-law
no way!

290
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,700
When I sent you to Oxford
for Higher Studies!

291
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,030
You cried mad!

292
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,230
You too father!

293
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,700
Grandpa,You could've told me!

294
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,020
...I would've talked with foreign Minister
and opened a Oxford's Branch we!

295
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,700
You donkey! You were not even
born at that time!

296
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,870
This is our country's
ill fortune!

297
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,540
Okay!......one second!

298
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,560
I'll call you later,okay!

299
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,550
Whose phone was it,that you had
to move away from me!

300
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,560
Come on tell. what's
the matter?

301
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,400
You're correct!

302
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,400
First,I thought I'll hide
this from you!

303
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,410
..But these things never
remain secret!

304
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,060
If you come to know...

305
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,240
...That there's someone else to share
my love with you!

306
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,010
What will you do then?

307
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,080
I'll kill myself!

308
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,820
Raj,do you love anyone else?

309
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,080
I haven't done it,I think
I'll start now...

310
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,090
What?

311
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,080
Doctor had called!

312
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,090
Report's are positive!
Priya,You're pregnant!

313
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,260
What? Am I going to become
a Great Grandfather?

314
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,270
Long live happily! Long live...

315
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,270

340
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,470
...No...Balraj..No...

341
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,800
From today it's no to sweets!

342
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,970
Now,I want to live longer!

343
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,310
Hereafter I don't have any
need for this!

344
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,310
...Now that my walking partner
is coming!

345
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:49,300
Hereafter I'll follow all your
instructions!

346
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,820
Hey! Chotu,look,after years
Big Boss is going for a walk!

347
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,150
..That too without a
walking stick!

348
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,490
All this is the Magic of
the daughter-in-law

349
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,640
Grandpa,when talks were on for
my marriage in this family!

350
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,080
I was scared!
-why?

351
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,150
I had once seen your photograph
in the Newspaper!

352
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,160
I thought,one who had such
menacing Monstache!

353
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,000
He'll definitely be strict and
will be like Hitler!

354
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,830
I've to be scared & put
the veil!

355
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,500
But after coming here,I came to
know that you're very Modern!

356
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,340
Now,I feel that you're not Raj
but my grandfather!

357
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,000
Madam,this time,we had a
great crop this reason!

358
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,000
Each branch bearing
100's of Mangoes!

359
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,170
Hey! were you plucking mangoes
or counting it?

360
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,850
Hey! Stop this fight and carry
on with your work!

361
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,010
This will go to Sharma's,keep
this in that basket!

362
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,020
And sister-in-law,this is
for kumar's!-Please give!

363
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,050
Put into that basket!

364
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,580
Madam,please take this!

365
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,010
Oh! My child,how many times I had
warned you not to lift heavy articles?

366
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,850
Take away those unripe mangoes!

367
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,360
Where did you go early
in the morning?

368
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,520
I went out for shopping!

369
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,020
What for?

370
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,190
For Maharana Pratap!

371
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,520
....I mean for the photo
of Maharana Pratap!

372
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,020
Why?

373
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,520
Because if a six months pregnant woman
whatever she watches more!

374
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,730
..The child will imbibe
those qualities!

375
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,520
If we keep this photograph
in Priya's bed room!

376
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,700
Then the coming child will also be
courageous like Maharana Pratap!

377
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,370
Have you gone mad?

378
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,030
If he becomes like RanaPratap!

379
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,540
...He'll be fighting with a sword
all his life in Jungles!

380
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,800
We must make the child a
great cricketer only

381
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,040
What will he do becoming
a circketer!

382
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,040
Unnecessarily he will get trapped
into match fixing!

383
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,040
Our child should become a
great leader!

384
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,380
...One who'll march this
nation towards progress!

385
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,370
So,In the bedroom of Priya...

386
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,040
What happened?....
Have you slept?

387
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,720
...I am thinking about which leader's
photograph should I hang there?

388
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,560
Can this humble man suggest
a thing?

389
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,220
Come on tell?

390
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,060
It can solve the problem of
all the three!

391
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,060
Keep some film Actor's
photograph in her room!

392
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,550
He can do,Leader's role cricketer's
Role,& even Rana Pratap's Role!

393
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,220
How good had it been
if you were quiet?

394
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,730
Leader's photograph-
Leader's photograph!

395
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,570
Why are you unnecessarly
fighting anmong yourselves?

396
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,070
Yes,my child,come on tell!

397
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,900
Why are you getting tensed
up for me?

398
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,410
I've already hanged the photograph
which I like the most!

399
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:45,570
what?

400
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,970
Oh!

401
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,650
Catch it!

402
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,820
Oh! I've broken my back!

403
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,330
What's this Bansi?

404
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,160
How can it be out,Grandpa!
this was a six!

405
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,600
Out means ...out!

406
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:09,830
What's this?

407
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,660
Mother,Grandfather's cheating!

408
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,170
My dear,It's our family Rule,one who
crosses beyond the bundary is out!

409
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,840
Now,give me the bat!

410
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,010
Oh! Tell me that,you want
to do the bating!

411
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,510
Yes...Yes...I want to bat!

412
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,170
You go and bat,I'll do
the umpiring!

413
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,500
Anyhow,you'll be out at the first ball
why are wearing a cap?

414
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,170
I've seen many who had
dared to bowl me out!

415
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,680
How fast you're bowling?

416
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,010
Before I could lift my bat the ball
whizzed part me,I am not out!

417
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,010
Hey! come on give him out!

418
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,750
No....No! it's out!

419
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,420
Hey! What are you saying?
It's definitely out!

420
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,850
What an umpire you are?
Father's certainly out!

421
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,350
Hey! You're not my friend!
you're a Traitor...Traitor!

422
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,200
What did we fix
earlier between us?

423
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,870
What could I do? when all of them
joined together,I had to give out!

424
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,530
What do you mean by saying
that you had to give out?

425
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,030
Fixing matches even in family!

426
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,190
I'll telephone and inform
sports minister! Right now!

427
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,700
Let it go my friend,
I'll not bat!

428
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,690
Now,its my chance to bat!

429
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,300
Okay....Okay...give me the ball!

430
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,860
Welcome...Welcome to bat!

431
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,580
Don't know to play cricket,still
wanting to keep Tendulkar's photo!

432
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,210
Watch,how I am going to
hit a six next ball?

433
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,040
Hit a six!?!

434
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,900
Daughter-in-law!

435
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:26,900
Not able to understand
anything!

436
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,740
It's already 2 hours,why doesn't
anyone tell me anything?

437
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,580
This Balraj also went inside,and
still hasn't come out!

438
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,750
What happened,uncle?

439
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,750
Everything's alright
isn't it?

440
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,920
She had miscarriage! The still born
died in the womb only!

441
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,590
,.....And priya!
-She is alright

442
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,760
.....Out of Danger!

443
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,600
God's great! Thanks!

444
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,600
...That our daughter-in-law
is safe!

445
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,760
Can me meet priya now?

446
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,760
It isn't good to disturb her
for 7-8 hours!

447
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,270
I feel,we all go home!

448
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,440
Since the accident no body's
peacefull!

449
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,110
You all go home I'll
stay here only.

450
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,440
No,Aunty! you go home,we
both will stay here!

451
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,280
Mother,I'll stay here!

452
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,270
But,son!

453
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,770
As soon as priya gets consious
I'll give you a call!

454
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,610
Come on.....Come.....come....Come!

455
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,120
A mother losing her child is
a great Disaster!

456
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,650
...doctors's calling you!

457
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:54,550
I'll come back soon!

458
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,660
Come Raj! come....Sit down!

459
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,330
Son!

460
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,670
In the accident priya's womb got
ruptured and became sceptic!

461
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,190
Because of which,priya can never
become a mother in future!

462
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,380
Even the Modern Technology can't
be of any help to her!

463
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,020
Son,you've to keep this as a secret
form your family!

464
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,530
If your Grandfahter comes to
know about this!

465
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,190
He already had two Heart attacks
He'll not be able to bear a third one!

466
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,370
But can I tell this to priya...

467
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,070
..That we'll keep away the
tears from us!

468
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:06,580
Shall we go?

469
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:21,910
Children have come!

470
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,590
I don't want any cries
& Cadoleaves!

471
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,760
Everyone will behave as if
nothing has happened?

472
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,090
Undersatood!?!
-Yes!

473
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,420
Go...Go back to your
normal work!

474
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,750
Welcome...Welcome my children!

475
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,250
What a long life my daughter-in-law
has been blessed with?

476
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,580
Think of her, & she's here!

477
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,420
Long live my child!

478
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,430
Watch out in a year owr house
will reverberate with a child's cries!

479
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,930
Be happy with family
and kids!

480
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,610
Enough!....No....
priya...no...

481
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,940
No...My child! please
don't cry!

482
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:15,150
Why this sorrow for a still born?
Cool on down!

483
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,120
Oh! My child miscarriage is
an ordinary matter!

484
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,610
My friend too had a miscarriage
But now she's mother to 4 kids!

485
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,610
What? In this time of family
plannings 4 children?

486
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,620
Pappu,register a complaint aganst
her friend with the police!

487
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:33,620
Why police,I can now call family planning
Minister and put her in jail

488
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,300
Hey! Her husband himself is
the family planning minister!

489
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,130
You can't touch him!
Call the Prime Minister!

490
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:39,800
Where will he be?

491
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,790
Why are you laughing? I can call
even Bill Clinton

492
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,960
What's happening here? why are you
talking own problems? busy with your

493
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,960
No body's concerned about daughter-in-law
she has just come out of Hosiptal!

494
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,140
Yes my child,go
and take rest!

495
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,640
Today,I'll prepare all your favourite
dishes! Come,sister-in-law!

496
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,310
Pappu,make a provisions list
-certainly!

497
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,130
Don't you want to
go to office?

498
00:48:59,330 --> 00:48:59,830
Definitely!...come...come..

499
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,970
Daughter-in-law,you go to your
room and take rest!

500
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,980
Raj,take her!

501
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,320
What happened?

502
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,160
Did you see the eyes of
your family members?

503
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,330
There's an expectation
in every eye!

504
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,830
...That in the near future,I'll present
them with a heir to this family!

505
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,170
One day they'll definitely come
to know that...

506
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,000
We have deceived them! What will
happen at that time?

507
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:55,340
You don't worry about that
I've a plan...

508
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:00,330
Come on tell,how do you feel
if we adopt a child?

509
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,670
Look! Father always tells me to
go abroad to look after business!

510
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,210
If you agree,we'll go abroad
for a year or two!

511
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,180
We'll adopt a child there!
Okay?

512
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,520
And,I'll explain everything
to Doctor uncle!

513
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,020
We've been left with no choice!

514
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,210
Grandpa!

515
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,690
Come...my child...come!

516
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,370
My respects to you grandpa!

517
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,040
Bless you my child!

518
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,200
Come sit,my child!

519
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:53,870
Were you crying?

520
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,380
No!...these are tears of
happiness,my child!

521
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,380
While reading the newspaper
I fell asleep!

522
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,720
...And in that sleep I had a
very nice dream!

523
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,050
...That I've become
great grandfather!

524
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,870
A small child was playing
in my lap!

525
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:16,720
...And was laughing!
Exactly like Raj!

526
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,550
Similar eyes...similar smile!

527
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,890
As I bent my head to
fondle the child!

528
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,990
..that rogue caught
my monstache!

529
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,400
In that happiness tears
rolled out of my eyes!

530
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:34,230
Do you know my child,the morning
dreams will always come ture!

531
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,390
I'll give myself entirely to
my husnabd only!

532
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,570
Look will you give if I
ask you anything today?

533
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,070
Why do you ask?
Everything is yours!

534
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,240
If I wish to give it to some one
else which is mine!

535
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,090
Give it what's
the problem in it?

536
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,820
You marry again!

537
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:26,760
What?!!

538
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:33,590
Today,grandfather dreamt of a Raj
a replica of you! Playing in his lap!

539
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,930
He doesn't want anyone,he wants
your progeny only!

540
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,600
Now you only tell!

541
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,420
How can we play on their sentiments
by calling an adopted as your son!

542
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,940
I am at the disadvantage!
I can't become a mother!Raj

543
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,770
But you can become a
father,isn't it?

544
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,270
Agree to it. Raj.please!

545
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,780
The accident which you had,
If it had happened to me!

546
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,950
Would you've married again?

547
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:08,610
Look!

548
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:53,480
Raj. I want to meet
you immediately!

549
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,650
What's the matter?

550
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,470
I can't tell it on phone!

551
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:59,350
Do one thing come to lndia Gate
I'll also come there!

552
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,310
Alright,I'll come!

553
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,320
Read this news!

554
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,980
How lucky that woman would've been
who was like me,but now has a child!

555
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,160
The only differece is that the womb
was of a different woman!

556
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,490
You mean test tube Baby?!

557
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,330
No,our family is so famous that this
test tube matter will never be a a secret!

558
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,500
That's means you
want me to.....

559
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,510
Yes Raj,if we get a girl who
could give birth to our child!

560
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,660
Look,If I wanted to beget a child
from some other woman!

561
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,170
Why would I have refused
for the marriage?

562
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,510
Why would I have talked about
adopting a child?

563
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,510
Because,I love you so much!

564
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,510
..And I don't want to share
it with anyone

565
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,510
Raj! We'll get difficulties
freely!

566
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,020
For your child I am ready to share
your love with other woman also!

567
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,180
Priya,even if I accept,where would
we get such a woman?

568
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,520
If It's written in my fate
to become a mother!

569
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,190
We'll definitely find a woman!

570
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,700
The contract which you entered
with your  friend...

571
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,860
Will she help me?

572
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,700
..This is your Air Ticket
to Mumbai

573
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,200
What happened? You seem to
be very disturbed!

574
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:46,040
Nothing Ms.Bharucha! -
Please sit down! A small problem!

575
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,210
You tell me your problem,I'll
solve it,just like that!

576
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,380
Ms.Bharucha,this problem can't be
solved just like that

577
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,220
It'll take minimum 9 months!

578
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,550
What?
-yes!

579
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,710
One of my friend needs
a girl

580
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:01,380
Is it? Is he handsome
like you?

581
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,720
Yes he's handsome,Rich and ready
to give everything!

582
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,290
...A house, a car,everything! But,all he
needs is just a child!

583
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:15,890
First let them get marry,I'll have
a cricket team ready

584
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:18,600
Problem is that he's
already married!

585
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,560
...And he doesn't want
a second marriage!

586
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:21,430
What?

587
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,290
...A child wihtout marriage!

588
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,930
Any problem?

589
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,170
You've mistaken me!Am I
so cheap?

590
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,570
No...No...Ms. Bharucha
You've mistaken me!

591
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,470
I am not that sort of a guy I was just
discussing about my friends problem
that's all!

592
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,940
Let your friend and his
problem go to hell!

593
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,240
Understood ?

594
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,120
Till now our relationship was
restricted to freindship!

595
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,120
But from today,it has entered
even in our business!

596
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,060
I am very happy to announce that
all products of Raj's companies!

597
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:20,860
...Will be exclusievly marketed
in Europe by Mr. Ajay sharma!

598
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:26,930
The first product to be lauched
will be discussed with Raj

599
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,530
Will she help me?

600
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,900
Mr. Raj,I know about
your problem?

601
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,410
I am ready to help you!

602
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,080
You're very nice!

603
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,480
Priya will be very happy
to hear this!

604
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,410
Raj! Mrs. Kapoor is asking about your
opinion in the product!

605
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,250
Yes! sir,I was asking,which product
should be launched first?

606
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,120
Actually,I was thinking
something else!

607
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,020
Can we discuss it in
next meeting?

608
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,440
Where do you want to go?

609
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:47,940
Straight!

610
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,650
Take a left from here!

611
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,260
Please,Stop here!

612
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,030
Switch of the light in the vehicle
and start here itself!

613
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,650
Is your house here? I don't
find anything here!

614
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,220
Why do you need a house?

615
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,600
What?

616
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,830
It's an Ac car It'll be
most exciting

617
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,100
I generally take as Rs.1000
a night

618
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,240
But,If you wish,you can pay
Rs.100-200 less also!

619
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,330
You've mistaken me...Seeing you...
I just gave you a lift

620
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,340
I was escorting you to home!

621
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:28,810
You mean?

622

01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,450
Is the cloth of bad quality or
the colour will fade?

778
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,520
It's costly,you
can't buy them!

779
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,690

Neither I want to sell my shop
nor any clothes to you!

787
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:42,690
Hey! Oldy! does decent people's

01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,370
Don't touch me!

790
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,700
Do you consider me so cheap?

791
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:52,370
Hey! Oldy! I'll not spare you!

793
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:58,040
Idiot...fool!

794
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,560
Showing faces to me....

Where are you going

Look Madam,I am the
general manager here!

That you'll not tell this to Mr.Raj!

819
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:21,590
Who's this Mr.Raj?
-With whom you've come here!

820
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:27,260
So,my handsome's name

01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,770
Now,are you also going to come with me?

823
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:34,600
Where's my handsome?

824

The first product to be lauched
lnternationally will be.

829
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:03,450
Come here!

830
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,950
The money which you gave me
that shop owner told me.

831
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:18,620
..He refused to sell the clothes
for girls like me!

832
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,130

Go to the room and
order the food!

01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:26,460
Idiot,you can eat with
these people!

836
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:44,970
Raj,Who's she?
-She's a friend!

837
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:49,810
She's a friend,but is she
a time pass?

838
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,150
She's a good girl!

839
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,580
She's a good girl! But she's
a street girl,isn't it?

840
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:01,320
Who's not a street smart man here?
Are you not a street smart man?

841
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:02,150
I too....

842
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,990
What was the necessity for
you to come down?

843
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:11,820
What was that urgent work for
you come and disturb the meeting?

844
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,500
If you're ashamed of me,why didn't
you warn me to come down?

845
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,500
You could've locked me up in
the bathroom?

846
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:18,490
That shop owner also called
me a cheap!

847
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,330
He refused to sell,saying that he'll
not sell to girls like me.

848
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:30,170
why are you staring at me? I don't
show my anger on food!

849
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,340
If you want
go and get it!

850
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:32,170
No,I don't want!

01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:33,670
Which shop man?

852
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:35,670
The shop on the other side of the
street,that big shop

853
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:36,670
What did he say?

854
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,680
He misbehaved and called me cheap!
Now..even you too!

855
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:47,010
I had forgotten that you've come
from a different world!

856
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,510
I didn't come,you brought
me here!

857
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,010
Leave that and take this!

858
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:55,020
Keep this!

859
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,190

To the same shop to buy
the clothes!

861
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,010
I'll not come there!

862
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:17,530
What happened?

863
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,030
Only today someone has talked
with me so respectfully!

864
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,360
Come lets go!

865
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,540
She's with me!
-you?

866
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,720
You've come to our shop,
It's a great honour for us!

867

873
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,060
Please have soft drinks madam

Look at this do you

878
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:24,740
No?!

879
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,070
I had come here decided that...

880
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,740
...I'll buy your entire shop!

881
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,070
But,your shop doesn't have
anything like that!

882
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,240
Which will look beautiful
on her!

883
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,410
And you like anything?

884
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:37,910
Shall we go to some
other big shop?! come.

You're too hot! Have
this cold drunk!

886
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,410
Oldy,don't do anything
like this next time!

887
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,090
What are you doing?

889
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,590
This is small bottle!

890
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,920
This small bottle will make
a big hole in the liver!

891
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:08,760
Give it to me!

892
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:14,420
Look,madhu,my wife should
never know about your past!

893

going to make me skin head?

895

896
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:15,970
Oh! come,leave it!

897
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:19,460
Only a woman can understand
the sorrow of a woman!

898
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:20,630
I was right isn't it?

01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,030
Last time you came on Honemoon &
I didn't disturb you

932
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,890
But this time you'll have to
stay with us

933
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:11,330
This time also we'll have
to stay seperately

934
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,500
Because office is very close
to Banglow!

935
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,070
And there is plenty of work in
the office this time

936
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,670
Okay but.....

937
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:18,810
My son's head shaving
ceremony is there

938
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:22,110
And both of you will have to stay
with us for a week

939
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,750
Come,I'll drop you

940
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:25,640
No my car has come

941
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:27,810
Okay,I'll take you upto
your car..come

942
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:48,000
Madhu this is our house,we're
going to stay here

943
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:50,500
Wonderful,house between
the hills

944
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:52,100
I'm thrilled to
see the hills

945
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,520
Seeing the snow
I've melted

946
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,030
Mr.Teacher

947
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:04,700
You've taught all this?

948
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,400
I tried a bit

949
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,040
Doesn't matter,I'll teach
her the rest

950
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:17,750
Come Madhu

951
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,850
How did you like the house
-it is fantastic

952
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:28,910
This is my room

953
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:33,020
And this is yours

954
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:14,510
Madam

955
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,210
Madam,this coat has
got stuck

956
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:20,110
Okay,I'll take it out

957
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:24,020
Don't call me Madam,call
me Priya

958
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,550
Oh God! how can I utter
your name?

959
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:27,350
The way I utter your
name

960
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,280
There is no sir & Madam
here,okay

961
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:34,350
Oh God! you've such a big
swimming pool in your room

962
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,390
We can swim whenever
we want

963
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:41,750
If you like it then you stay here
I'll go to your room

964
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,990
I'll bring my things

965
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:52,840
Madhu liked this room,so I gave it
to her I'll stay in the guest room

966
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:53,760
That's right

967
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,690
We've already seen
this room

968
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:57,960
Let's see the guest room also
let's go

969
01:27:59,330 --> 01:27:59,700
Not like this

970
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,060
The way I brought you
to this room

971
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:05,810
Same way I'll take you to
the guest room

972
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,710
This is my room,not yours
that's your room

973
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:25,580
I know it,but my wife
is here

974
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:28,610
You're mine,isn't it

975
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:30,380
Yes-then

976
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:52,070
Oh God! Fruits,Vegitable,Groceries
slippers all in 1 shop-yes!

977
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:54,890
Madhu you take whatever
you want,Okay-yes

978
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:33,660
Just now,they've announced that
heavy snow fall is likely

979
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,420
And all roads'll
be closed

980
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,690
Raj is coming to pick us
up shortly

981
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:38,960
You do one thing

982
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:52,370
You understood what you've
to do,isn't it?

983
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:07,340
You bought things for the
whole year,Oh!

984
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:09,640
Where is Priya,still
shopping?

985
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,710
No,she went away home

986
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,350
What! doesn't she know there is going
to be snow storm here

987
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:15,120
She knows

988
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,450
She had to buy certain things from
near the house

989
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:19,620
That's why she went away,by now
she must've reached home

990
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:22,120
Keep the trolly,come
I'll do it!

991
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:24,950
From there,that side

992
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,480
Madhu phone is ringing

993
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:13,320
Yes Priya

994
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:15,820
Where are you?

995
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:17,650
In the church

996
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,310
Stay there I am coming to
pick you up

997
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:22,990
How can you come? all roads are
closed because of snow fall

998
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:26,820
But you don't worry about me
I've many people here with me

999
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:28,990
As soon as the roads are clear
I'll come

1000
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:32,820
You've closed the paths

1001
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:36,670
Take it that way

1002
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:40,000
But if you two are
not alone

1003
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,990
How'll we get rid of
our lonliness

1004
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:23,360
I am sorry,I had mixed a little
Vodka in coca cola

1005
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:29,360
It is very cold outside
that's why....

1006
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,920
I love my wife
immensely

1007
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:58,010
You've become mother

1008
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:01,850
She has become mother

1009
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:07,020
Ten lakhs-ten lakhs!

1010
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:12,030
Congratulations Raj

1011
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,700
Bless daughter-in-law on
my behalf

1012
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:19,860
Listen you take the 1st
flight & come here

1013
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:21,190
No no grandpa,that is
not possible

1014
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:24,700
Because according to doctor,Priya is not
allowed to take a long flight

1015
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:27,030
Alright don't come!

1016
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:28,870
Don't bring the
daughter-in-law at all

1017
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:31,040
But look after daughter-in-law
over there

1018
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,200
What's happining grandpa?

1019
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,380
Here talk to your mother

1020
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:36,210
Son Raj-yes mother!

1021
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:39,710
Raj,congratulations may God
give my life also to you

1022
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,870
Give phone to daughter-in-law

1023
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:42,700
I won't give,one second!

1024
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:46,870
Wish you a long happy life
don't lift heavy things

1025
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:47,540
Yes yes

1026
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:51,050
And the Charan that I had given you
tie it on the wrist

1027
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:52,380
Tie it on your hand

1028
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:04,720
And take care of
daughter-in-law

1029
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:11,720
Congratulations,kept
the phone down

1030
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:34,900
What's this? It has
sacred flowers in it

1031
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:36,910
Mother-in-law has given me for
the protection of the child

1032
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,070
Always keep it on your hand

1033
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,070
It'll protect the child

1034
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:35,580
See it's months,there is no
bulge on the stomach

1035
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:42,910
It won't come in 3 months only
after 5 months it'll show

1036
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,920
When I was expecting last time
I was also worried like you

1037
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:48,580
Mother-in-law had told me

1038
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:53,590
Mother-in-law! she's a
dangerous creature!

1039
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,930
No,my mother-in-law
is not like that

1040
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,600
She is very nice,she loves
me a lot

1041
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:01,430
And grandpa of Raj...

1042
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:04,430
He doesn't consider me as daughter-in-law
I am the grand daughter to him

1043
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,260
Who else is there
in your family?

1044
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,760
Grandpa's friend,
Doctor Uncle!

1045
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:12,590
Uncle,Auntie &
one Pappu brother

1046
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,600
He has very high contacts

1047
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,600
If any phone goes out of
order in the house

1048
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:17,940
He won't phone the mechanic

1049
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,940
He'll phone the telecome
minister directly!

1050
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:25,950
And his winking habit puts every
new person in a quandry

1051
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,600
Your inlaws place would be very
interesting,isn't it?

1052
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:31,610
Day must be passing off
very quickly

1053
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:35,450
It was like that earlier,but
since that happened with me

1054
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:41,450
But those days'll
return again

1055
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:48,290
Congratulations Raj!

1056
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:50,630
Our company has crossed the sales
of 10 millions

1057
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:54,120
It's nothing,It'll cross more than
10 millions,100 millions

1058
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,300
Hello sister-in-law,how
are you?

1059
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:57,960
I am fine

1060
01:45:58,650 --> 01:45:59,630
She's my friend,Madhu

1061
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,460
And he is Ajay,friend of Raj
and a businessman

1062
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,480
Come Madhu

1063
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:33,320
Yes Madhu,you are our VIP

1064
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:52,990
Hey son,come here!

1065
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:09,830
Raj,Vicky brother
has come

1066
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:15,840
Brother,sister-in-law
hasn't come

1067
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:17,680
Day after tomorrow,my son's head
shaving ceremony is there,isn't it?

1068
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,170
That's why she is busy there
but I've come,isn't it?

1069
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:22,520
And I've come to remind
you people

1070
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:25,190
That both of you must come for the
ceremony day after tomorrow

1071
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:31,520
I was thinking for a long time
as to where I had seen you

1072
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:33,180
Wonderful

1073
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:35,180
What a great change
has come over

1074
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:38,350
After seeing you nobody can say
that you're a prostitute

1075
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:45,360
Who told you?

1076
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:48,190
There is no secret
between me & Raj

1077
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,870
I also appreciate good things

1078
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,040
If the commodity is good
I don't bother about money

1079
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:04,700
As soon as you're free
from Raj,come over!

1080
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,040
What ever Raj is paying you
I'll give you double than that

1081
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:41,550
Why did you come away
from the party?

1082
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:44,050
I don't want to stay here
I'm going back

1083
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:47,220
What happened? did any one
say something?

1084
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,730
All rich people like you
are alike

1085
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:52,060
You play so many games
for your selfish ends

1086
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:54,730
First you gave me so much respect
elevated me to the sky

1087
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:57,560
And with one jerk you pulled me
back to earth

1088
01:48:58,930 --> 01:49:00,070
You wanted only a child
isn't it?

1089
01:49:00,430 --> 01:49:02,740
That I would have produced on
the road also

1090
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:05,400
What was the need to mature me
for your society

1091
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:08,570
When you had to tell your friends
that I'm a prostitute

1092
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:17,410
I never felt so cheap,when I was
in the proffession

1093
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:19,080
The way I am feeling
today

1094
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:21,090
Did Ajay say anything
to you?

1095
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,920
Madhu,I haven't said anything
to anybody

1096
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:33,760
Ay Madhu,where are
you going?

1097
01:49:34,450 --> 01:49:36,920
I am going back,he told
his friend that I....

1098
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:43,430
That I am pregnant
Ican't dance

1099
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:48,760
Madhu Raj & I are your friends
your well wishers

1100
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:53,090
We'll never say anything
that'll hurt you

1101
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,590
You want to dance,come..

1102
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,760
I don't want to dance

1103
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:13,940
A person who thinks someone
as his own

1104
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,270
He get's hurt by trifles

1105
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:21,940
Priya,I didn't tell you one thing
about Madhu

1106
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:24,950
I know,I have heard
everything

1107
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:33,120
You did the right thing by
not telling me this earlier

1108
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:38,290
May be after knowing the truth
I might not have accepted Madhu

1109
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:40,450
But today,I can say

1110
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:42,790
To give birth to our child

1111
01:50:43,490 --> 01:50:44,960
There couldn't have been a
better girl than Madhu

1112
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:47,460
Isn't it?

1113
01:51:05,010 --> 01:51:05,630
How is Madhu?

1114
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:10,650
I'm just coming from her room
she's still angry

1115
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,640
If we both go for the head shaving
ceremoney without her

1116
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:15,310
Then she'll feel very bad

1117
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:17,310
Then we'll also not go

1118
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:19,980
No..No..Vicky brother will be offended

1119
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:24,490
We'll do onething,I'll go for the
function,you stay here

1120
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:27,640
I'll give the excuse that you couldn't
come because of business compulsions

1121
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:32,980
Okay,pack your things,I'll drop
you at the station,come

1122
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:47,670
Drink this juice

1123
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,680
Cigarette is healthy to your
and child's health

1124
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,340
Madhu I know you're upset

1125
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,020
But,when you came to
the Bombay confrence

1126
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:14,850
The way you had dressed up
the way you had behaved that...

1127
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,840
Ajay was also present there

1128
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,510
When I didn't tell this to
my wife Priya

1129
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:25,020
Then why would I tell
it to Ajay?

1130
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:30,360
Even then if you feel I've
made a mistake

1131
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:41,360
Smoke the cigarette

1132
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:34,230
You were bathing?

1133
01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:37,570
Raj is not at home,he has
gone to the office

1134
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,060
Yes I know Raj has gone
to the office

1135
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,560
And,he'll come back late

1136
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:43,400
And Priya is also not at home
she has gone to her cousin

1137
01:53:43,930 --> 01:53:44,740
That's why I've come!

1138
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,580
From the time,I saw you at
the party

1139
01:53:51,770 --> 01:53:52,740
I couldn't control myself

1140
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:55,070
That's why I came here at the
very 1st opportunity

1141
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:59,570
I've enjoyed with
every type of Girl

1142
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:04,240
But,the attraction that you have
nobody else has it

1143
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:05,910
You please go away
from here

1144
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:08,750
Yes,I have understood

1145
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:12,080
You're in contract with Raj that's
why you're in tension

1146
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:14,420
There is no problem between
me and him

1147
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:18,420
He is not only my business partner
but my childhood friend also

1148
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:20,920
He'll have no objection

1149
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:32,100
You cheap prostitute
you slapped me!

1150
01:54:51,470 --> 01:54:53,100
Come on,get up...get up
over here..

1151
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:00,440
You're pretending to be
very decent,isn't it?

1152
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:02,280
I'll smash your decency

1153
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:47,980
Raj I had thought,that....

1154
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:49,640
What did you think?

1155
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:52,140
That,you'll rape her?
you'll rape her?

1156
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:54,480
Raj,what are you doing you'll rape
her?listen to me

1157
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:55,970
Raj listen to me

1158
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:56,970
You'll rape her

1159
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:00,970
Raj,listen to me

1160
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:12,150
Raj,what are you doing for a cheap
prostitute you're beating me

1161
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,150
Does she look a cheap
prostitute to you?

1162
01:56:18,850 --> 01:56:19,650
I don't find her that way

1163
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:26,650
How did she look like
that to you....?

1164
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:32,330
Raj for such a girl you're beating
your childhood friend

1165
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:40,170
Childhood friend!

1166
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:47,170
Even if you were my brother
I would have killed you

1167
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:55,170
Raj for her you're endangering
partnership worth 500 crores

1168
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:58,680
Why 500 crores for her

1169
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:02,020
For her,I'll forsake the entire
wealth of the world

1170
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:09,340
Do you know,why? because she
is priceless for me

1171
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:14,850
You're my friend,isn't it? that's
why you leave from here

1172
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:17,860
Otherwise I'll kill
you,understod

1173
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:20,030
Go..go..

1174
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:51,040
I'll bring medicines

1175
01:58:25,590 --> 01:58:27,900
If you need anything
call me

1176
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:29,540
Madhu,take this

1177
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:41,550
What were you thinking?

1178
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:45,390
I was remembering my
childhood

1179
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:51,400
When I was a kid

1180
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:54,390
My mother always used to
tell me a story

1181
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:56,900
That,there was a poor girl

1182
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:01,230
Oneday a prince came to her
on a white horse

1183
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:04,560
And took away his bride

1184
02:08:06,430 --> 02:08:08,240
And then,all her dreams
came true

1185
02:08:10,270 --> 02:08:13,250
Even I used to see this same
dream all the time

1186
02:08:18,270 --> 02:08:19,240
When I grew

1187
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:24,910
Instead of white horses many
white cars came

1188
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:28,420
Many princess got down
from them

1189
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:33,760
But nobody came to
take me with him

1190
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:36,920
All came to purchase me

1191
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:41,750
Then I realized

1192
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:46,090
That it was a fairy tale for
children in their childhood

1193
02:08:47,790 --> 02:08:49,260
It doesn't happen like that
in reality

1194
02:09:00,630 --> 02:09:03,600
Raj & Priya will be shocked
to see us

1195
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:06,270
Ay Chotu,take down the
luggage quickly

1196
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:07,600
How can I take
down so much?

1197
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:08,940
Come with me

1198
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,110
Priya,grandpa has come with
the entire family

1199
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:17,610
What?

1200
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:19,280
Is that your family?

1201
02:09:21,310 --> 02:09:23,290
Priya,it'll be a catastrophy,they think
that you're pregnant

1202
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:25,460
One second

1203
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:29,280
No no,it'll be too big!

1204
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:30,780
This....

1205
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:32,610
Yes,this is alright

1206
02:09:32,810 --> 02:09:33,790
Wear this charma also

1207
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:34,960
But there are sacred
flowers in it...

1208
02:09:35,150 --> 02:09:38,610
Yes yes,I know,give her the flowers
and you wear the charm

1209
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:39,120
Yes

1210
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:41,460
Daughter-in-law,we have
come

1211
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,460
Where are you,you'll be
overwhelmed

1212
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:48,960
Oh Grandpa,Mother

1213
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:52,300
Grandpa

1214
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:53,960
May you live long

1215
02:09:56,490 --> 02:09:57,970
Mother....
-we surprised you,isn't it?

1216
02:09:58,490 --> 02:09:59,800
God bless you,my son

1217
02:10:03,660 --> 02:10:04,970
You came without
informing

1218
02:10:06,670 --> 02:10:11,140
We couldn't wait to see Priya,so
we have come-where is Priya?

1219
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:12,310
She is tying the pillow

1220
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:14,150
Tying the pillow!

1221
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:16,300
Tying the pillow! what did
you all hear?

1222
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:17,310
What did you say?

1223
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:18,310
She is changing her dress

1224
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:27,150
Come my child,come....

1225
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:27,980
My child....

1226
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:28,660
Blessings mother

1227
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:32,150
God bless you,you have given us the
entire happiness of the world

1228
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:36,820
No..no child don't bend
down,God bless you

1229
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:38,980
Let me stop the evil eye
falling on you

1230
02:10:39,190 --> 02:10:39,990
Oh! Grandpa...

1231
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:40,980
How are you my child?

1232
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:41,660
I am fine

1233
02:10:44,190 --> 02:10:45,160
How are you,Pappu brother

1234
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:46,490
Hai! Uncle

1235
02:10:46,690 --> 02:10:47,820
How are you Priya child?

1236
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:53,000
Didn't I tell you that you'll
be pregnant within a year,isn't it?

1237
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:58,660
What mother,why did you all
give us such a surprise?

1238
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:16,020
What happened?
what happened?

1239
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:30,520
She is the wife of my
friend,Madhu

1240
02:11:31,210 --> 02:11:34,520
Her husband generally stays away
for business

1241
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,360
There is no one else in the house
that's why she stays with us

1242
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:38,520
I see....

1243
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:40,860
You did the correct
thing my child

1244
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:43,200
At this time you shouldn't
live alone

1245
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:45,370
Come...come here

1246
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:48,540
Blessings....

1247
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:49,870
Always be happy

1248
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,700
I'm Priya's mother-in-law

1249
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:52,860
I know

1250
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:55,030
Priya daily tells me
about you all

1251
02:11:55,890 --> 02:11:59,700
You are auntie,you are uncle
and you are Pappu brother

1252
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:01,700
And you're grandpa

1253
02:12:02,570 --> 02:12:02,870
Blessings

1254
02:12:03,070 --> 02:12:05,200
Don't bend down
blessings

1255
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:06,210
And you are the father

1256
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:10,220
Grandpa won't you take away
the evil eye frome me?

1257
02:12:16,150 --> 02:12:20,410
Why not,may you live long
and married

1258
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:29,220
It's not surprising why our
dark hero Mithun stays in Ooty

1259
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:31,820
So that,he looks fair among
the people who stay there

1260
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:34,760
Grandfather....Biscuts

1261
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:40,950
Madhu my child,what is
your Husband's business?

1262
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:43,260
He!....

1263
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:44,930
He is into Import & Export

1264
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:48,630
Yes grandpa,that's why he is sometimes
in UK,Austrlia!....

1265
02:12:49,060 --> 02:12:49,830
He's always out of station

1266
02:12:50,490 --> 02:12:51,060
I see...

1267
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:53,560
Whatever it may be business
will anyways go on

1268
02:12:53,930 --> 02:12:56,210
But in such times,a husband should
necessarily be with his wife

1269
02:12:56,370 --> 02:12:57,810
Daughter-in-law,no problem

1270
02:12:58,670 --> 02:13:00,840
Like the way,we'll take
care of our Priya

1271
02:13:01,110 --> 02:13:02,730
In the same way,we'll
take care of her too

1272
02:13:26,950 --> 02:13:29,750
After listening to this God Vishnu
started crying after becoming a child

1273
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:32,750
And after seeing that beautiful
face of him

1274
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:37,260
Tears of affection & happiness rolled
out from mother Kausalia's eyes

1275
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:41,430
They say,if the description of
God Rama's birth

1276
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:43,600
Is heard by a pregnant woman

1277
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:45,610
Even her child likes it

1278
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:47,770
You just feel and watch

1279
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:51,090
There definitely would be some
movement going on inside

1280
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:09,450
Madhu child,why are you
standing there,come here & sit

1281
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:12,790
Come....come...sit

1282
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:19,780
Listen,at the time of
God Rama's birth

1283
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:22,120
The condition of
his father Dashrath

1284
02:14:22,810 --> 02:14:26,450
Because,the amount of happiness which
the mother undergoes in delivering it's child

1285
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:28,620
The father feels
twice of her

1286
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:34,130
Child,what are
you thinking?

1287
02:14:36,330 --> 02:14:38,450
That your husband is not
with you,isn't it?

1288
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:42,630
He definitely would be
helpless about this

1289
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:47,290
But he always would be thinking
about you & your child

1290
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:50,140
Poet Tulsidas said....

1291
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:03,310
Priya,my child
-yes mother

1292
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:05,480
Child,this is that
spicy sweet

1293
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:06,810
Do you remember?

1294
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:08,820
I have brought it for you
from Delhi

1295
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:21,990
Madhu come...

1296
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,490
Mother has brought for me spicy
sweets from Delhi

1297
02:15:26,690 --> 02:15:28,820
You'll really be benefitted
if you eat it..eat.....

1298
02:15:35,690 --> 02:15:36,170
It's spicy,isn't it?

1299
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:40,000
Last year,when I was expecting even
I found them very spicy

1300
02:15:40,190 --> 02:15:43,000
That's why mother forcibilly made
me eat,making me sit infront of her

1301
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:44,340
Will you have one more?

1302
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:48,000
Mother is coming,don't say
that I had it

1303
02:15:51,210 --> 02:15:52,000
Yes mother

1304
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:55,870
Oh! you are here,I was searching
you in your room

1305
02:15:55,870 --> 02:15:55,880
I was sitting with
Grandpa
Oh! you are here,I was searching
you in your room

1306
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:57,170
I was sitting with
Grandpa

1307
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:01,180
What's the matter,you
are crying?

1308
02:16:01,370 --> 02:16:06,840
No...I was watching a melodramatic
film,that's why

1309
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:08,180
Come with me

1310
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:12,530
Sit down,carefully....

1311
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:16,350
Madhu child,these are
spicy sweets

1312
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:19,850
After eating it,both the mother & the
child are benefitted a lot

1313
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:21,020
Come on eat it....

1314
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:23,190
Mother,no I'll eat it later

1315
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:26,690
No....not later,you'll have to eat it
before me,otherwise,you'll not

1316
02:16:26,890 --> 02:16:29,370
No...mother.-I know it's a little
spicy that's why

1317
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:35,030
Come on,open your mouth
open...good-No...

1318
02:16:42,060 --> 02:16:45,370
Madhu,there's a lot of
swelling on your feet

1319
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:50,310
I had told the Doctor about it
but he said,it's quite normal

1320
02:16:50,970 --> 02:16:53,670
It definitely happens,but a
lot of swelling is not good

1321
02:16:54,470 --> 02:16:57,180
I'll apply oil on your feet
made of 7 herbs

1322
02:16:57,380 --> 02:16:58,350
It reduces the swelling

1323
02:16:59,610 --> 02:17:00,140
Yes madam

1324
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:01,790
Bring that oil made
of 7 herbs

1325
02:17:01,980 --> 02:17:02,410
I'll get it

1326
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:04,670
Keep it

1327
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:06,540
Show me my child

1328
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:10,590
No..No mother,I'll not like
you touching my feet

1329
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:12,560
But,I'll like it

1330
02:17:13,210 --> 02:17:14,420
Once,that I have adressed
you as my daughter

1331
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:16,320
I also mean it
from my heart

1332
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:18,560
You are my daughter
isn't it?

1333
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:33,900
Who all are there in
your family?

1334
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:37,230
Mother,I have no one

1335
02:17:39,330 --> 02:17:40,240
There must be someone in
India,isn't it?

1336
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:45,070
I have no one
in the world

1337
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:57,170
Hereafter,don't ever say,that
I have no one in the world

1338
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,580
From now,this entire
family is yours

1339
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:24,600
Greetings Mr.Priest
how are you?

1340
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:26,160
Yes one minute

1341
02:18:26,790 --> 02:18:27,960
Grandpa...it's Mr.Priest's
phone from Delhi

1342
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:30,260
What's the number of
the facility Minister over here?

1343
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:34,130
Yes Mr.Priest...greetings

1344
02:18:34,370 --> 02:18:35,100
Whose phone is this?

1345
02:18:35,570 --> 02:18:36,940
What was he saying?-I don't know

1346
02:18:38,570 --> 02:18:39,730
Alright we'll do exactly
as you say

1347
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:43,100
You make the arrangements
yes.. okay...

1348
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:44,780
Grandpa, what
arragements?

1349
02:18:44,970 --> 02:18:49,940
Raj, Mr.priest has chosen 18th as the
date for priya's lap filling ceremony.

1350
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:50,610
Congratulations.

1351
02:18:50,810 --> 02:18:52,610
We''ll go to Delhi tomorrow itself,
okay

1352
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:59,460
Raj, how can we go
back to India?

1353
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:01,290
Even Madhu has to be with us,
isn't it

1354
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:05,950
Because,18th has been fixed as
priya's lap filling ceremony

1355
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:10,950
You go along with Raj to the
office, call for a board meeting

1356
02:19:11,150 --> 02:19:12,280
And make everyone understand
-yes father

1357
02:19:13,150 --> 02:19:15,630
Grandpa,is it not possible,if
you call Mr.priest here itself?

1358
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:17,130
And acomplish the ceremony
here itself.

1359
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:18,130
Why?

1360
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:20,460
Because, Priya's delivery date
is also of this month

1361
02:19:21,330 --> 02:19:23,130
And ...,the medical facilities
over here are also very good

1362
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:25,140
What are you talking
about facilities?

1363
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:28,130
I'll make one phone and get
all the facilities transferred to Delhi

1364
02:19:30,490 --> 02:19:32,630
There is no facility of a
minister itself over here

1365
02:19:32,830 --> 02:19:34,960
I see..., Bihar is a
better place than this

1366
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:38,970
Raj my son. We''ll get all the
madecal facilities in Delhi

1367
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:41,140
And such a ceremony is done
at that place

1368
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:43,140
Where there are friends,
relatives etc.

1369
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:46,150
Mother, you are right.
We''ll all go to lndia.

1370
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:51,140
Madhu, I had promised
your husband.

1371
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:52,470
That I'll take
care of you.

1372
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:53,310
But,we are all going to India
for the lap filling ceremony

1373
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,820
Because, your's of Priya's delivery
date,fall on the same day.

1374
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:00,310
And I can never go
against Grandpa.

1375
02:20:00,510 --> 02:20:04,150
But, I'll do all your hospital
bookings etc

1376
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:06,490
And whenever you get the
labour pain.you yourself go.

1377
02:20:08,020 --> 02:20:09,660
Have you gone out of
your brains?

1378
02:20:10,350 --> 02:20:12,830
How will this poor go alone to the
hospital in such a condition?

1379
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:15,320
Grandpa, she does'nt have
any other alternative also,isn't it?

1380
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:18,830
Who is with her,and she also can't
come to India with us.

1381
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:19,830
Why can't she come?

1382
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:22,500
You had promised her husband
isn't it

1383
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:23,660
Yes, I had

1384
02:20:23,860 --> 02:20:26,670
Everybody listen,this is
my decision,

1385
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:29,000
That, Madhu will come
to Delhi along with us

1386
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:35,510
Greetings...

1387
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:41,340
Greetings...

1388
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:43,840
He is my father, and they
are my brother & sister-in-law

1389
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:45,500
What have they brought?

1390
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:46,180
An auspicious offering

1391
02:20:46,700 --> 02:20:48,680
In the lap filling ceremony,
the pregnant woman.

1392
02:20:48,870 --> 02:20:50,010
Wears clothes brought only from
her parent's house

1393
02:20:50,370 --> 02:20:52,510
Great..., Is this such
a big ceremony?

1394
02:20:53,380 --> 02:20:53,850
Blessings...

1395
02:20:54,210 --> 02:20:57,020
Come... come...
Greetings... come

1396
02:20:57,380 --> 02:20:59,520
Pappu,Just listen, Mr.Priest
is asking for rice

1397
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:00,350
Please make the
arrangement

1398
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:01,510
should I call the
food minister

1399
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:02,520
Tell me,how many bags
you want?

1400
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:04,850
Oh god,for a handful of rice,
will you call up the minister

1401
02:21:05,050 --> 02:21:06,680
Handful..
Bring it from the kitchen

1402
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:07,520
Allright

1403
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:11,860
Have you seen Bhati uncle
somewhere?

1404
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:14,860
I haven't,but,what's
the matter?

1405
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:17,690
Are you immitating me?

1406
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:24,700
Did your mother ever come & go
at fathehpur's red bungalow?

1407
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:29,360
Fathepur's Red bungalow, No,
my mother never went

1408
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:31,870
My father freequently
visited there

1409
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:41,870
Father always used to say
that son,you have one sister

1410
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:43,380
Father...

1411
02:21:47,910 --> 02:21:51,370
Priya, your auspicious dress has come,
now soon get ready

1412
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:55,210
Mother, you go down, I'll
make Priya get ready

1413
02:21:57,910 --> 02:22:00,550
No Daughter, you can't
come down

1414
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:04,550
Look,I wanted both of yours
ceremonies to be performed together

1415
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:07,230
But Mr.Priest said,that two
pregnant women together

1416
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:09,570
Can't participate in
this function

1417
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:10,890
Allright mother

1418
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:18,890
And Priya my child,today get ready
exactly like a bride,fully decked up.

1419
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:19,390
Allright

1420
02:22:20,590 --> 02:22:23,900
This ceremony is a very important
event in any woman's life

1421
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:28,070
Because a woman does'nt have
one birth,but she has 3 births

1422
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:32,240
The first when she becomes someone's
daughter & comes into this world

1423
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:35,580
The second,When she becomes
someone's wife.

1424
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:39,410
And the third,when she
becomes a mother

1425
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:44,580
And why this ceremony is performed bofore
a woman becomes mother is because

1426
02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:47,740
That the forthcoming child gets
so many blessings & prayers

1427
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,910
that its birth is not
with pains

1428
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:51,920
But its with
happiness

1429
02:22:56,620 --> 02:22:59,760
Now, soon get ready & come down
the time for the ritual is nearing.

1430
02:22:59,950 --> 02:23:00,760
Allright

1431
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:06,420
Raj,you here,now don't
involve priya in your talks-

1432
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:08,250
She has to get ready & come down
allright

1433
02:23:09,290 --> 02:23:11,090
Raj,I can't come in this
function

1434
02:23:11,390 --> 02:23:11,760
Why?

1435
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:14,260
Mother said, that this is
not any ordinary ritual-

1436
02:23:14,630 --> 02:23:18,260
All these prayers etc are for the
well-being of our child

1437
02:23:19,130 --> 02:23:21,770
Madhu should sit in this
ritual instead of me

1438
02:23:23,130 --> 02:23:24,270
But,how is this possible?

1439
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,430
If madhu wears my
Bridal dress-

1440
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:27,930
The veil would be there
isn't it?

1441
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:30,940
And nobody will come to know
that she is Madhu

1442
02:23:47,650 --> 02:23:50,620
Madhu,will you wear the
auspicious dress?

1443
02:23:52,810 --> 02:23:53,290
Allright

1444
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:16,130
Sister-in-law,just see if priya
has got ready or not?

1445
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:16,960
Bring her at once

1446
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:17,630
Allright sister

1447
02:24:17,830 --> 02:24:19,630
Aunty,I'll go & see
-mother,I'll go

1448
02:24:19,830 --> 02:24:21,460
Saw,allright,you
itself get her

1449
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:30,310
Who's it?

1450
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:31,480
It's me

1451
02:24:37,510 --> 02:24:38,310
Has madhu got ready?

1452
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:39,640
Yes

1453
02:24:41,170 --> 02:24:42,150
Girls...

1454
02:24:44,010 --> 02:24:44,810
The auspicious thread...
I forgot

1455
02:24:45,010 --> 02:24:46,820
Listen.. I'll make her wear
you go

1456
02:24:47,010 --> 02:24:48,150
Alright,I'll go that side

1457
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:26,670
make it fast...

1458
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:56,350
The one who is going to furnish
my clan with a heir,I salute you

1459
02:25:57,720 --> 02:25:59,700
May God let your child
live forever

1460
02:26:00,890 --> 02:26:03,370
And the way, how sun shines
the entire world-

1461
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:06,870
In the same way,your child
should shine my entire generation

1462
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:18,540
May god, my age should add
to your child

1463
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:21,710
And he brings so much
happiness in your life

1464
02:26:22,730 --> 02:26:25,040
That no happiness of the world
can match against it

1465
02:26:30,410 --> 02:26:34,550
Priya,Great,the color of heena has
blended so thick on your hands-

1466
02:26:35,410 --> 02:26:38,540
This means,Raj loves
you a lot

1467
02:29:42,850 --> 02:29:47,490
We have to take a family
photograph,come everyone come

1468
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:52,830
Yes, take the photograph

1469
02:31:29,740 --> 02:31:31,220
Mr.priest, you start
the prayers

1470
02:31:31,410 --> 02:31:31,890
Allright

1471
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:41,890
What is the name of the
child's great grand father?

1472
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:49,560
May this great grandchild receive
all the happiness of the world

1473
02:31:49,930 --> 02:31:51,560
What is the child's
grandfather's name?

1474
02:31:54,590 --> 02:31:58,400
May this child receive
all the fame

1475
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:00,740
What is the child's
grandmother's name?

1476
02:32:02,770 --> 02:32:05,570
May god bless this child

1477
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:07,410
What is the child's
father's name?

1478
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:13,910
May god make this
child live forever

1479
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:06,940
Mother...

1480
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:08,280
Today's function was great
isn't it?

1481
02:33:08,470 --> 02:33:10,280
Excellent, what was
the best among it?

1482
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:12,110
Great grandfather's Dance,
what do you say?

1483
02:33:13,470 --> 02:33:16,610
What stromy winds are blowing
I'll get these windows closed

1484
02:33:17,140 --> 02:33:19,950
Look,it's too late,
you go and sleep

1485
02:33:21,150 --> 02:33:21,950
God bless you

1486
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:11,650
Did you see Madhu
anywhere?

1487
02:34:13,850 --> 02:34:14,140
What?

1488
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:36,820
Madhu,where are you going?

1489
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:41,660
This child's mother is not
Priya Malothra,its me

1490
02:34:43,190 --> 02:34:51,340
This is my child,I'll not give my child
forgive me,I can't give this child

1491
02:34:51,870 --> 02:34:53,170
Madhu, don't say like this

1492
02:34:53,530 --> 02:34:56,010
For the last 9 months I have
undergone penance for its birth

1493
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:58,180
Everyday I have weaved one new
dream for this child

1494
02:34:58,540 --> 02:34:59,520
At this time, not
only me or Raj-

1495
02:34:59,870 --> 02:35:03,500
But our entire family is counting
days for the childs birth

1496
02:35:03,880 --> 02:35:06,000
Madhu,all our happiness
is linked with it

1497
02:35:06,540 --> 02:35:09,340
I'll kill myself,but I'll
not part with my child

1498
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:14,010
Madhu, you don't lack anything
unlike me,you can get married

1499
02:35:14,210 --> 02:35:15,350
You can again experience
motherhood

1500
02:35:15,710 --> 02:35:20,180
But I... I am incomplete,
I can never become a mother

1501
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:24,360
Madhu,I beg of you,please
give me this child

1502
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:28,520
In return of it,I'll give you
what ever you want

1503
02:35:33,220 --> 02:35:36,030
Allright,I am prepared to
give you my child

1504
02:35:36,890 --> 02:35:38,370
Can you give me
your husband?

1505
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:51,360
After all,you showed your
true colour

1506
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:55,370
I thought even a prostitute
was a woman

1507
02:35:56,730 --> 02:36:01,040
But you've proved that a prostitute
can never do good to anyone

1508
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:03,380
She can only destroy
houses

1509
02:36:04,410 --> 02:36:06,050
I asked you your
husband from you

1510
02:36:06,580 --> 02:36:08,380
You made me remember
my status

1511
02:36:08,910 --> 02:36:11,050
You are asking form
a mother,her progeny

1512
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:12,870
Mother,whether she is
a prositute

1513
02:36:13,080 --> 02:36:14,210
Or a daughter-in-law
of a house

1514
02:36:14,580 --> 02:36:16,050
Mother is only a mother

1515
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:23,550
I'll not... I'll not give
you my child, I'll not...

1516
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:28,550
Raj,she is refusing to
give us our child

1517
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:29,730
Priya,but first look
at her condition

1518
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:36,240
Immediately call up
doctor uncle

1519
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:48,400
Everthing wil get allright

1520
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:10,580
Madhu's scanning is
in progress

1521
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:13,420
In a very short while,we'll
come to know the complications

1522
02:37:16,950 --> 02:37:17,590
It's mother's phone..

1523
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:19,600
Yes mother

1524
02:37:19,790 --> 02:37:21,760
You,priya,Madhu all the
three of you are not in house?

1525
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:22,760
Where are you all?

1526
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:24,100
Mother,we're all
at the hospital

1527
02:37:24,460 --> 02:37:25,930
Madhu and priya had
developed labour pains-

1528
02:37:26,290 --> 02:37:27,090
So,I've brought them here

1529
02:37:30,120 --> 02:37:31,260
We all are reaching
the hospital

1530
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:36,930
No mother no,you come at ease
okay,doctor uncle is with us

1531
02:37:37,290 --> 02:37:38,600
Oh god! I am
just coming.

1532
02:37:40,630 --> 02:37:41,770
Doctor has called you in.

1533
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:49,760
The child in the stomach
has turned around-

1534
02:37:50,140 --> 02:37:51,770
That's why the child is not
at it s normal position.

1535
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:54,440
All right,go ahead.

1536
02:37:54,630 --> 02:37:55,770
But,the condition
is serious.

1537
02:37:56,140 --> 02:37:59,600
I can either save the mother
or child in this operation

1538
02:38:02,310 --> 02:38:03,790
We'll have to take the decision
at the earliest

1539
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:14,120
Doctor,you save
the mother.

1540
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:20,460
Make arrangements to take
her to the operation theatre.

1541
02:38:20,650 --> 02:38:22,290
Nurse,take Raj's signature
-okay

1542
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:35,810
Take her in,
careful....

1543
02:39:08,180 --> 02:39:11,490
This happens very rare,the
operation was sucessful.

1544
02:39:12,350 --> 02:39:14,160
Both Madhu and
child are safe.

1545
02:39:24,690 --> 02:39:25,990
Congratulations,its
a boy baby.

1546
02:39:55,870 --> 02:39:56,850
How sweet child it is.

1547
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:02,510
You wanted to save the mother
Isn't it.

1548
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:05,690
Even the mother
got saved.

1549
02:40:06,380 --> 02:40:07,520
And your child too.

1550
02:40:10,890 --> 02:40:15,190
I got carried away for a while
and became selfish.

1551
02:40:17,550 --> 02:40:19,860
You are this
child's mother.

1552
02:40:24,060 --> 02:40:25,030
He is only yours.

1553
02:40:43,570 --> 02:40:45,550
Give me my Grandson...

1554
02:40:49,570 --> 02:40:52,710
Look....Look I am your
Great Grandfather.

1555
02:40:58,420 --> 02:41:01,040
Oh yes,what about our madhu
a boy baby or a girl baby?

1556
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:06,060
That poor girl's child
at its birth....

1557
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:16,400
No child,don't get
disheartened.

1558
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:18,730
Think that it was
not yours.

1559
02:41:19,930 --> 02:41:21,730
The same thing happened
even with our priya-

1560
02:41:22,930 --> 02:41:26,230
But did you see,in 1 year's time
god blessed her with another child.

1561
02:41:27,430 --> 02:41:28,060
Yes daughter

1562
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:56,910
Madhu,don't go I'll disclose
the truth to my family members.

1563
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:02,260
When two Brother's can stay
together,under one roof.

1564
02:42:03,450 --> 02:42:04,760
Then why can't two
sister's stay?

1565
02:42:07,790 --> 02:42:09,260
I have got my complete
family here.

1566
02:42:10,460 --> 02:42:11,930
I only lacked
a sister.

1567
02:42:13,790 --> 02:42:14,760
Today,I even
got that

1568
02:42:16,790 --> 02:42:18,260
Let this sister remain
as sister.

1569
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:21,100
Don't make her
a co-wife.

1570
02:42:22,790 --> 02:42:27,260
Otherwise,no woman would ever
have belief on another woman.

1571
02:42:31,300 --> 02:42:35,110
Only you have rights on
this family,and on Raj.

1572
02:42:37,140 --> 02:42:40,770
My rights are only on those
remembrabces,which I got here.

1573
02:42:51,140 --> 02:42:52,120
What more do
I want?

1574
02:43:05,650 --> 02:43:09,460
Madhu,you have been checked-in
This is your boarding pass.

1575
02:43:10,490 --> 02:43:11,790
Your bags have been sent
into the luggage.

1576
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:14,960
In this,there are keys
of your new house-

1577
02:43:16,830 --> 02:43:19,130
And some blank cheques
on your name.

1578
02:43:21,830 --> 02:43:23,470
The deed which you have done
for me and for priya.

1579
02:43:25,340 --> 02:43:27,130
For that,even if I give you
my entire wealth-

1580
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:28,800
Even then,its less.

1581
02:43:30,830 --> 02:43:37,470
Just consider this to be a
small gift from me & priya.

1582
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:40,650
I have taken my gift,
look at this-

1583
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:44,980
I am taking my entire
family along with me

1584
02:43:46,180 --> 02:43:49,310
Other than this,If I take
anything else,it'll look as though-

1585
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:52,490
A mother has taken a price
for her child.

1586
02:43:53,340 --> 02:43:54,320
But Madhu,you....

1587
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:58,650
I'll not return back to that world
from where you had brought me.

1588
02:44:03,190 --> 02:44:07,000
You had touched me once,here after
no one else can touch me!
